For the annual report to NSF for our geometry and topology RTG grant, I'm collecting input from people supported by the RTG grant for the time period from May 2021 to April 2022. So all questions below refer to your activities during that time period.

\medskip


\noindent{\bf Research activities:} {\color{red} Please describe your research activities in a paragraph or two. If references are needed, please put them immediately following this item. 
}

I am doing a summer research project with Mark Behrens. We have been
looking at the dual Steenrod algebra and the Adams
spectral sequence (ASS).  Our goal is to study the motivic Adams
spectral sequence.

\noindent{\bf Other scholarly activities:} {\color{red} e.g., organizing learning seminars, participation in the bridge program, the directed reading program, or outreach activities.}

I sometimes attended the topology seminar.

\noindent{\bf Talks given:} {\color{red} Please list title, name of conference (if applicable), location, and month; include talks given at Notre Dame, and zoom talks}

N/A.

\noindent{\bf Conferences attended:} {\color{red} Please list all, including for example the midwest topology seminars, or zoom conferences}

I sometimes attended the The electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Seminar.

\noindent{\bf Classes enrolled in:}

In fall I enrolled in complex analysis with G\'abor Sz\'ekelyhidi,
topics in topology: 3-manifolds with Andy Putman, topics in geometry:
moduli of curves with Felix Janda, and in spring I enrolled in
topology 2 with Mark Behrens, topics in topology: cobordism with Chris
Schommer-Pries, and differential geometry with Matthew Gursky.

\noindent{\bf Publications:} {\color{red} Please list papers that were accepted/published in a Journal or posted to the archive (if a paper was posted on the archive in an earlier funding period, but has now been accepted/published by a journal, please list it; for journal submissions: please indicate whether the paper has been accepted or actually published at this point). Do not list papers in preparation. {\bf Important:} Please indicate for each publication whether it acknowledges NSF support. Please include in future publications related to research done during RTG support an acknowledgement along the lines of  "This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number DMS-1547292"}
