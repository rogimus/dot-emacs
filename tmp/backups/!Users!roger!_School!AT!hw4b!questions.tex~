Compute $\Tor_1^{\bbZ} (\bbZ/n, \bbZ/m)$.

\subsection*{Question 2}{\bf [Hatcher 2.2.14]}

A map $f:S^n\to S^n$ satisfying $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all $x\in S^n$ is
called an \emph{even map}. Show that every even map $S^n\to S^n$ must
have even degree, and that the degree must in fact be zero when $n$ is
even. When $n$ is odd, show there exist even maps of any given
degree. [Hint: If $f$ is even, it factors as a composition $S^n\to
\bbR\bbP^n \to S^n$. Using the computation of $H_n(\bbR \bbP^n)$ in
the text, show that the induced map $H_n(S^n)\to H_n(\bbR\bbP^n)$
sends a generator to twice the generator when $n$ is odd. It may be
useful to show that the quotient map $\bbR\bbP^n \to\bbR\bbP^n /
\RP^{n-1}$ induces an isomorphism on $H_n$ when $n$ is odd.]
