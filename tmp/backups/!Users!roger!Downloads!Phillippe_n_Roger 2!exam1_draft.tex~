%Q 1
\begin{problem}
If $\displaystyle f(x) = \sin(x)$ and $g(x) = 4x$, which of the following is the graph of 
$$\displaystyle y = \frac{1}{2}g(f(x)) =  \frac{1}{2}(g\circ f)(x)?$$
(Make sure you  look carefully at the labels on both axes.)

Solution: Note that $y=\frac{1}{2}\times 4 \sin(x)=2\sin(x)$. The only two plots with the correct range are (a) and (d), and (a) is $2\sin(x)$ and (d) is $2\cos(x)$, so the answer is (a).

%Q2
\begin{problem}
What is the domain of the following function?
$$f(x) = \sqrt{\frac{x -1}{x - 2}}$$

Solution: $\frac{x-1}{x-2}$ is nonnegative on $(-\infty,1]$, negative between $(1,2)$, undefined at 2, and positive for $(2,\infty)$. Since the square root function $g(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is only defined for non-negative numbers, it follows that the domain of $f(x)$ is $(-\infty,1]\cup(2,\infty)$.

\begin{answers}
$\dxd (-\infty, 1] \cup (2, \infty)$\\
$\dxd (-\infty, 1) \cup [2, \infty)$\\
$\dxd [1, 2)$\\
$\dxd (1, 2)$\\
$\dxd (2, \infty)$\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}

%Q3
\begin{problem}
The height (in feet) of a ball thrown vertically upwards on the planet Pilko at time $t = 0$(sec.) is given by 
$$\dxd h(t) = 15 - t^2 + 2t, \ \ t \geq 0$$
At what time  does the ball first hit the ground?

Solution: The ball hits the ground when $h(t)=0$. The easiest way to solve this equation is to factor: 
$$h(t)=15-t^2+2t=-(t^2-2t-15)=-(t-5)(t+3)=0$$
Therefore the solution is $t=5$ (we discard $t=-3$ since $h(t)$ is defined only for $t\geq0$ and it makes no sense to consider the ball hitting the ground at a negative time).


\begin{answers}
$\dxd t = 5$\\
$\dxd t = 3$\\
$\dxd t = 6$\\
$\dxd t = 4$\\
$\dxd t = 2$\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}


%Q4
\begin{problem}
Consider the piecewise defined function:

$$ p(x) = \begin{cases}
\dxd \ \  x^2 &\mbox{if } -\infty < x < -1 \\
\dxd \ \ x &\mbox{if } -1 \leq x < 1 \\[6pt]
\dxd \frac{1}{x -2} & \mbox{if } 1 \leq x < \infty\\
 \end{cases} $$
 
 
Which of the following statements are true?
\vskip .1in
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\dxd \lim_{x \to 1^-}p(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^+}p(x)$.\\
\item $\dxd \lim_{x \to -1^-}p(x) = p(-1)$.\\
\item The domain $P(x)$ is all real numbers.\\
\item $\dxd \lim_{x \to 2^-}p(x) = +\infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\vskip .1in
\noindent
Hint: You should be able to determine the validity of the statements  from  a sketch of the graph. 

Solution:

 $\lim_{x \to 1^-}p(x)=1$ and $\lim_{x \to 1^+}p(x)=\frac{1}{1-2}=-1$, so (1) is false.

$\lim_{x\to-1^-}p(x)=1$ and $p(-1)=-1$, so (2) is false.

$p(x)$ is defined for all real numbers $x$, so (3) is true.

As $x\to2^-$, the denominator $x-2$ approaches 0, but stays negative, so $ \lim_{x \to 2^-}p(x)=-\infty$. Therefore (4) is false, and thus the answer is (a).


\begin{answers}
Only statement  (3) is  true.\\
None of the  statements are true. \\
Only statements (3) and (4) are true. \\
Only statements (1) and  (2) are true.\\
Only statement  (2) is true.\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}










%Q5
\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
$$\lim_{x\to2}\frac{3 - \sqrt{x^2+ 5}}{x - 2}.$$

Solution: The function is discontinuous at $x=2$ because the denominator evaulates to 0 at $x=2$, so to find the limit we multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of $3-\sqrt{x^2+5}$:
$$\lim_{x\to2}\frac{3 - \sqrt{x^2+ 5}}{x - 2}=\lim_{x\to2}\frac{3 - \sqrt{x^2+ 5}}{x - 2}\left(\frac{3 +\sqrt{x^2+ 5}}{3 + \sqrt{x^2+ 5}}\right)=\lim_{x\to2}\frac{9-(x^2+5)}{(x-2)(3+\sqrt{x^2+5})}$$
$$=\lim_{x\to2}\frac{4-x^2}{(x-2)(3+\sqrt{x^2+5})}=\lim_{x\to2}\frac{(2-x)(2+x)}{(x-2)(3+\sqrt{x^2+5})}=\lim_{x\to2}\frac{-(2+x)}{(3+\sqrt{x^2+5})}=\frac{-4}{3+\sqrt{2^2+5}}$$
$$=\frac{-4}{6}=\frac{-2}{3}$$
\begin{answers}
$\dxd - \frac{2}{3}$\\
$- 4$\\
$\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}$\\
$- \infty$\\
$4$\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}



%Q6

\begin{problem}
Compute 
$$\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to1^-}\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2x + 1}}.$$

Solution: To find the limit we can factor the denominator:
$$\lim_{x\to1^-}\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2x + 1}=\lim_{x\to1^-}\frac{x-2}{(x-1)^2}$$
Note that the numerator goes to $-1$ as $x\to1^-$ and the denominator goes to 0 as $x\to1^-$, but is positive for all $x\neq 1$. Therefore the limit is $-\infty$ (you can think of it as being of the form $\frac{-1}{+0}$, although this is obviously not formal terminology).



\begin{answers}
$-\infty$\\
$0$\\
$\infty$\\
$1$\\
Does not exist and is not $+\infty$ or $-\infty$\\

%Q7

\begin{problem}
For what value of  $c$ is the function $f$ given by
$$f(x)=\begin{cases}\dxd cx^2&\dxd  x < 1\\[10pt]
\dxd  x + c &\dxd x \geq 1\\
\end{cases}$$
continuous at $x = 1$?

For $f$ to be continuous at 1, we need to left and right limits to match and equal $f(1)$. Note that $\lim_{x\to1^-}f(x)=c(1)^2=x$ and $\lim_{x\to1^+}f(x)=1+c=f(1)$. These two limits therefore equal when $c=1+c$. Cancelling $c$ gives $0=1$, a contradiction, so there is no $c$ making the left and right limits equal and therefore no value of $c$ makes $f$ continuous at 1.

\begin{answers}
No value of $c$ makes $f$ continuous at $1$.\\
$\dxd c = 1$\\
$\dxd c = -\frac{1}{2}$\\
$\dxd c = \frac{1}{2}$\\
$\dxd c = 2$\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}



%Q8

\begin{problem}
Let $\dxd f(x) = \cos(x\pi)$. 
Which of the following limits gives the value of $f'(1)$?\\
\vskip .1in
\noindent
Note: Pay careful attention to the $h \to ...$ part.

Solution: By the definition of the derivative, the answer is $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\cos(\pi+h\pi)-\cos(\pi)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\cos(\pi+h\pi)+1}{h}$$


\begin{answers}
$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\cos(\pi + h\pi) + 1}{h}$\\
$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\cos(\pi + h\pi) - 1}{h}$\\
$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 1}\frac{\cos(\pi + h\pi) - 1}{h}$\\
$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\cos(\pi + h) + 1}{h}$\\
$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 1}\frac{\cos(\pi + h) + 1}{h}$\\
\end{answers}
\end{problem}


%Q9

\begin{problem}
If $k(x)$ is a function with $x^4 - x^2  \geq k(x) \geq x^3 - 3x + 10$ for all $x$ in the interval $2 \leq x \leq 3$, 
which of the following gives the value of $\dxd \lim_{x \to 2^+}k(x)$?

Solution: Note that $\lim_{x\to2^+}x^4-x^2=2^4-2^2=16-4=12$ and $\lim_{x\to2^+}x^3-3x+10=2^3-3\times2+10=8-6+10=12$. By the squeeze theorem it follows that $\lim_{x\to2^+}k(x)$=12.

\begin{answers}
$ 12$ \\
$-1$ \\
$0$ \\
$4$ \\
$\dxd \lim_{x \to 2^+}k(x)$ does not exist.\\

\begin{problem}
The graph of $f(x)$ is shown below:\\

\centerline{\Fbox{2.5in}{f.jpg}}
\vskip .1in
\noindent
Which of the following is the graph of $f'(x)$?

Solution: $f(x)$ is decreasing from negative infinitity to about -0.2, increasing from about -0.2 to about 1.6, and decreasing from 1.6 to infinity. Therefore the graph of $f'(x)$ should be negative on $(-\infty,-0.2)$, positive on $(-0.2,1.6)$, and negative again on $(1.6,\infty)$, with roots at -0.2 and 1.6 (again, decimal values are estimated). The only graph satisfying those conditions is (a).

%Q11
\begin{problem}
A  particle  moving along a straight line has velocity given by a degree 2 polynomial, $\dxd v(t) = at^2 + bt + c$,
at time $t \geq 0$. 
The particle is moving forward when $v(t) > 0$ and is moving backwards when $v(t) < 0$. 
We have the following information about the velocity:
$$v(1) = v(2)  = 0, v(0) = -2$$
\vskip .1in
\noindent
(a) Use the information given above to find an expression for $v(t)$. 

Solution: $v(1)=0$ implies that $v(1)=a+b+c=0$. $v(2)=0$ implies that $v(2)=4a+2b+c=0$. Finally, $v(0)=-2$ implies that $c=-2$. Plugging in $c=-2$ into the other two equations gives $a+b-2=0$ and $4a+2b-2=0$. The first equation implies $a=2-b$, and plugging that into the second gives $4(2-b)+2b-2=0$, or $-2b=-6$. Therefore $b=3$ and $a=2-3=-1$. Therefore $v(t)=-t^2+3t-2$.


\vskip 0.5in
\noindent
(b) What is the velocity of the particle when $t = 3$.

Solution: The velocity of the particle at $t=3$ is $v(3)=-3^2+3\times3-2=9+9-2=16$.


\vskip 0.5in
\noindent
(c) On which time intervals is the particle moving forwards?  (make sure you justify your answer).

Solution: The particle is moving forwards when the velocity is positive. Since the velocity is a quadratic polynomial, this is easily found by finding the roots of $v(t)$ (which are at $t=1$ and $t=2$ as given in the problem statement), and observing the $a=-1$, so the graph looks like an upside-down U, meaning that the function is positive in between the two roots. Therefore the particle is moving forwards on the interval $(1,2)$.
\vskip 0.5in
\noindent
(d) On which time intervals is the particle moving backwards?  (make sure you justify your answer).

Solution: Following the solution of part (c), the velocity is negative (i.e. the particle is moving backwards) on the time intervals $[0,1)\cup(2,\infty)$.

%Q12
\begin{problem}
(a)  Find the derivative of
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{2x + 1}$$
using \underline{ the limit definition} of the derivative.

Solution:
\begin{equation*} 
\begin{split}
f'(x)&=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\frac{1}{2(x+h)+1}-\frac{1}{2x+1}}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\frac{1}{2(x+h)+1}-\frac{1}{2x+1}}{h}\left(\frac{(2(x+h)+1)(2x+1)}{(2(x+h)+1)(2x+1)}\right)\\
&=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2x+1-(2x+2h+1)}{h(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{-2h}{h(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{-2}{(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}\\
&=\frac{-2}{(2x+1)^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\vskip 1in
\noindent
(b) use your answer from part (a)  to find  the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $y = f(x)$ at $x = 1$. 

Solution: The tangent line is the to $f(x)$ at $x=1$ is the line that touches the graph of $f(x)$ at $x=1$ and has the same slope as $f(x)$ at $x=1$. The slope is given by $f'(x)=\frac{-2}{(2(1)+1)^2}=\frac{-2}{9}$, so the line is of the form $y=\frac{-2}{9}+b$. To intersect the graph, note that $f(1)=1/3$, so $1/3=-2/9+b$, so $b=5/9$. Therefore the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=1$ is $$y=\frac{-2}{9}x+\frac{5}{9}.$$

%Q13
\begin{problem}
(a)  Show that there is at least 1 solution to the equation
\begin{displaymath}
x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1 = 0
\end{displaymath}
in the interval $0 < x < 1$.\\
Justify your answer, identify any theorems you use and verify that the required conditions for their use hold true.\\
%

Solution: Let $f(x)=x^6+2x^4-x^2-1$ for convenience. Note that $f(0)=0^6+2(0)^4-0^2-1=-1$ and $f(1)=1^6+2(1)^4-1^2-1=1$. Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial and hence is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem we can conclude that $f(x)$ has at least one root between 0 and 1, or in other words the equation $
x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1 =0$ has a solution in the interval $0<x<1$.
\vskip 1in
\noindent
(b) Is $f(x) = x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1$ an even function, or an odd function, or neither?\\
Justify your answer.

Solution: Every power of each term the polynomial is an even power, so the function $f(x)$ is even.
\vskip 1in
\noindent
(c) Use your results from parts (a) and (b) to show that the equation $\dxd x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1 = 0$ has at least two solutions.

Solution: From part (a) the equation $x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1 = 0$ has some solution in the interval $0<x<1$, call it $c$ for instance. Because $f(x)$ is even, $f(c)=0$ implies that $f(-c)=f(c)=0$. Therefore  $x^6 + 2x^4 - x^2 -1 = 0$ has at least two solutions.
