** plan for summer
Perhaps we want to think about slice spectral sequences.
Starting point will be to dive into Ravenel's green book and learn
about the Steenrod algebra, and the ASS.

Later on we might look into the interplay between the ASS in the
category of motivic spectra over \(\mathbb{C}\) and the ANSS in
spectra.

For the immediate future we will look at [[https://klein.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/cobordism.pdf][Miller's notes on
cobordism]]. Focus on the mod 2 story for now.

** maths from today
We began by thinking about steenrod squares as a way to detect
differences in cohomology. For example, we began by looking at the
\(\mathbb{F}_2\)-cohomology of \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) and \(S^1\vee
S^2\).
These have the same underlying vector spaces with something in degree
0,1,2, however there is a difference in the cup product structure
(for \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) we get \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]/x^3\) but for
\(S^1\vee S^2\) we get \(\mathbb{F}[x,y]/(x^2,y^2)\)). However,
suspending makes the cup product trivial. Thus we can't use this to
detect the difference between the cohomology of
\(\Sigma\mathbb{R}P^n\) and \(S^2\vee S^3\). Another way to detect the
difference is with a steenrod square. In particular, one of the axioms
of the steenrod $sq^i$ is that $sq^{|x|}(x)=x^2$. So $sq^1$ detects
the difference between $\mathbb{R}P^2$ and $S^1\vee S^2$. Steenrod
squares are stable however, and so they also detect the difference
between $\Sigma \mathbb{R}P^2$ and $S^2\vee S^3$.

As another example, we looked at constructing $\mathbb{C}P^2$ as the
cofiber of the Hopf map
\[ S^3\xrightarrow{\eta} S^2 \to S^2\cup_{\eta} e_4 \cong
\mathbb{C}P^2. \]
Then $\mathbb{C}P^2$ has a nontrivial action by $sq^2$. Thus this
$sq^2$ is detecting the non-nullhomotopicity of $\eta$!

The steenrod algebra is the $\mathbb{F}_2$ algebra generated by the
Steenrod squares. Cohomology groups have an obvious action by the
steenrod algebra and so form modules of the Steenrod algebra. Maps of
cohomology groups are thus actually Steenrod algebra module
homomorphisms. 

*Slogan:* Actions from the steenrod algebra can detect differences in
cohomology, and in particular can detect whether maps are
nullhomotopic or not.

We discussed the Hopf invariant. To define is, suppose we have a map
\[ S^{2n-1}\xrightarrow{f} S^n. \]
Then the cofiber is $Cf = S^n\cup_f e_{2n}$. Given a generator
$x\in H^n(Cf)$ and $y\in H^{2n}(Cf)$ we have $x^2=ky$ for some
$k$. This $k$ is the Hopf invariant of $f$. It turns out that $k=0$
whenever $n$ is not a power of 2. To see this, we considered the irreducible (?
don't remember if this is the correct terminology) steenrod
operations. To find these we take the non-unit part (?) of
$\mathcal{A}$, call this $\mathcal{I}$, then consider
$\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$. This is called $Q\mathcal{A}$ or
something? They're the steenrod operations which aren't the composite
of any others. It turns out that $Q\mathcal{A}$ consists of $sq^{2^i}$
for some $i$. In particular, if $n$ is odd then $sq^n$ is reducible,
so then $sq^n$ factors through some trivial cohomology group, and must
therefore be 0. Since $sq^n(x)=x^2$ we have $x^2=0=0y$.

It turns out the Steenrod algebra is actually a Hopf algebra. In
particular we get a coproduct from the Cartan formula. We can dualize
(because of finite typeness or something???) an we get the dual Steenrod
algebra $\mathcal{A}_*$. This is apparently much simpler with the
structure
\[ \mathcal{A}_* = \mathbb{F}_2[\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots].\]
where $\xi_n$ has degree $2n-1$. The coproduct is something like
\[ \Delta \xi_n = \sum_{i+j=n} \xi_i^{2^j}\xi_j \]
where $\xi_0 = 1$.

** Convergence of Spectral Sequences

Mark mentioned a beautiful paper by Boardman on this. I think the
paper he's referring to is called "Conditionally Convergent Spectral
sequences.

This arose after I mentioned we had to make certain assumptions about
our staircase diagram to make sure it converges (assumptions like all
but finitely many of the vertical maps being isomoprhisms and not
going off to infinity in both directions for example).


** TODO Serre fibrations and fiber bundles

Mark proved that fibre bundles were Serre fibrations. In particular,
you can locally trivialize, and then it's easy to prove it for trivial
fiber bundles.

** Proof of the description of the $E^2$-page for the Serre spectral sequence.

Mark gave a really nice description of this proof. In particular, he
used a particular fact that the pullback of a pushforward is again a
pushforward.

We have a pullback diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
\coprod S^{p-1} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & B^{p-1} \arrow[d] \\
\coprod D^p \arrow[r, "f_i"] & B^p.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
This gives rise to another pullback diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
\coprod f_i^*X_p |_{\partial D^p}  \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & X_{p-1} \arrow[d] \\
\coprod f_i^* X_p \arrow[r, "f_i"'] & X_p.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The left vertical map is a Serre fibration (pullbacks of Serre
fibation are again a Serre fibration).
Then you have some fact about how Serre fibrations over spheres are
trivial ???? Thus we could write $f_i^* X_p$ as $D^p\times F$ and $f_i^*
X_p |_{\partial D^p}$ as $S^{p-1}\times F$.
Thus we end up with an isomorphism
\[\bigoplus_{p-\text{cells}} H_*(D^p\times F, S^{p-1}\times
F)\cong H_*(X_p,X_{p-1}).\]
Using a relative version of the Kunneth theorem we get that the LHS is
\[ \bigoplus_{p-\text{cells}} H_*(D^p,S^{p-1}) \otimes H_*(F) \cong
H_*(B^{p},B^{p-1})\otimes H_*(F). \]

I think the reason we need simply connectedness (or trivial $\pi_1$
action) is that if we don't have this then taking coefficients in
$H_*(F)$ becomes tricky... since following some loop back to the same
point may change this homology. Instead what we do is take local
coefficients, which is basically taking a $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$ for every
$H_*(B^{p}, B^{p-1})$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$ where
$\pi$ is the fundamental group of $B$. I need to figure this stuff out
more....


** HOSS and HFPSS

We mentioned/talked about the Homotopy Orbit SS and the Homotopy Fixed
Point SS. This came up in relation to the proof of Lemma A.1 in
Miller's cobordism notes.

If we had some unpointed $G$-space $Y$, we can define the homotopy orbits of $Y$
as $Y_{hG} := EG\times_G Y$. Since $EG\simeq *$ we get that this is a
"fattened up" version of $*\times_G Y$. We get a fiber bundle $Y_{hG}\to
BG$ with fiber $Y$ and the Serre SS applied to this gives something
called the \emph{homotopy orbit spectral sequence}.

Similarly we can dualize everything to get the homotopy fixed point
spectral sequence. Somehow the dual of $EG\times_G Y$ is instead to
take $Y^{hG}:= \textrm{Map}_G(EG,Y)$. Call $Y^{hG}$ the homotopy fixed
points (which is again a "fattened up" version of $\textrm{Map}_G(*,Y)
= Y^G$).

Another thing that came up is the fact that \[H^p(BG; H^q(F))= H^p(G;
H^q(F)). \]
i.e. taking group cohomology. This makes the proof fairly easy since
$H^0$ is then just fixed points of $H^q(F)$.
