\section{Preliminaries}

Let $G$ be a group. A \textbf{universe} is a countably
infinite-dimensional real inner product space $U$ equipped with an
action by $G$ such that $G$ acts via isometries, and such that $U$
contains: the trivial representation; and countably many copies of
each irreducible representation of $G$.

A universe is \textbf{trivial} if it contains only the trivial
representation. A universe is \textbf{complete} if it contains each
irreducible $G$-representation. (Andy Blumberg mentions this allows us
to dualize orbits? Is this referring to the fact that $U$ has to
contain all dual reps?)

Let $S^V$ denote the one-point-compactification for a subset
$V\subset U$. Let $\Sigma^V X$ denote $S^V\smash X$, and let
$\Omega^V X$ denote the mapping space $\Map(S^V,X)$. $($Note that
function spaces are somewhat subtle. We take continuous maps, and put
the compact open topology on it, or more specifically like the
$k$-ification of the compact open? This gives us the adjoint
$X^{Y\times Z}\cong (X^Y)^Z$.$)$

A $G$-\textbf{prespectrum} (indexed on $U$) is a collection of
$G$-spaces $\{E_V\}$ indexed on subspaces $V\subset U$, together with
structure maps $\Sigma^{W-V}E_V\to E_W$ for each pair $W$ and $V$,
where $W-V$ is the orthogonal complement of $V$ inside
$W$. Equivalently the structure maps are of the form
$\Sigma^W E_V\to E_{V\oplus W}$.  A $G$-\textbf{spectrum} is a
$G$-prespectrum for which all the adjoints of the structure maps
$E_V\to \Omega^{W-V}E_W$ are homeomorphisms.

The positive \textbf{equivariant homotopy groups} of a
$G$-(pre)spectrum are defined to be
$\pi_n^H E = \colim_V \pi_{n}^H \Omega^V E_V$ where $H$ is a subgroup
of $G$, and $\pi_{i}^H X := [S^i\wedge (G/H)_+, X]^G$
\,\,$($i.e. $G$-equivariant maps that land in $X^H)$. The advantage of
spectra over prespectra is that we don't need to compute a colimit
since, by assumption,
\[ \pi_{n}^H \Omega^V E_V \cong \pi_n^H E_0.\] The negative homotopy
groups are instead defined as $\pi_{-n}^H E:= \colim_V \pi_0^H
\Omega^V E_{V+n}$.  $($ i.e. positive homotopy groups shift degree
down, but negative ones shift it up.$)$
