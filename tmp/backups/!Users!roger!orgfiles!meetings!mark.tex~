\section{Convergence of Spectral Sequences}
\label{sec:orgd728fd8}

Mark mentioned a beautiful paper by Boardman on this. I think the
paper he's referring to is called "Conditionally Convergent Spectral
sequences.

This arose after I mentioned we had to make certain assumptions about
our staircase diagram to make sure it converges (assumptions like all
but finitely many of the vertical maps being isomoprhisms and not
going off to infinity in both directions for example).


\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Serre fibrations and fiber bundles}
\label{sec:org3a90557}

Mark proved that fibre bundles were Serre fibrations. In particular,
you can locally trivialize, and then it's easy to prove it for trivial
fiber bundles.

\section{Proof of the description of the \$E\textsuperscript{2}\$-page for the Serre spectral sequence.}
\label{sec:orgb4547c3}

Mark gave a really nice description of this proof. In particular, he
used a particular fact that the pullback of a pushforward is again a
pushforward.

We have a pullback diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
\coprod S^{p-1} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & B^{p-1} \arrow[d] \\
\coprod D^p \arrow[r, "f_i"] & B^p.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
This gives rise to another pullback diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
\coprod f_i^*X_p |_{\partial D^p}  \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & X_{p-1} \arrow[d] \\
\coprod f_i^* X_p \arrow[r, "f_i"'] & X_p.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The left vertical map is a Serre fibration (pullbacks of Serre
fibation are again a Serre fibration).
Then you have some fact about how Serre fibrations over spheres are
trivial ???? Thus we could write \(f_i^* X_p\) as \(D^p\times F\) and \(f_i^*
X_p |_{\partial D^p}\) as \(S^{p-1}\times F\).
Thus we end up with an isomorphism
\[\bigoplus_{p-\text{cells}} H_*(D^p\times F, S^{p-1}\times
F)\cong H_*(X_p,X_{p-1}).\]
Using a relative version of the Kunneth theorem we get that the LHS is
\[ \bigoplus_{p-\text{cells}} H_*(D^p,S^{p-1}) \otimes H_*(F) \cong
H_*(B^{p},B^{p-1})\otimes H_*(F). \]

I think the reason we need simply connectedness (or trivial \(\pi_1\)
action) is that if we don't have this then taking coefficients in
\(H_*(F)\) becomes tricky\ldots{} since following some loop back to the same
point may change this homology. Instead what we do is take local
coefficients, which is basically taking a \(\mathbb{Z}[\pi]\) for every
\(H_*(B^{p}, B^{p-1})\) instead of \(\mathbb{Z}\) where
\(\pi\) is the fundamental group of \(B\). I need to figure this stuff out
more\ldots{}.


\section{HOSS and HFPSS}
\label{sec:orgf561dbe}

We mentioned/talked about the Homotopy Orbit SS and the Homotopy Fixed
Point SS. This came up in relation to the proof of Lemma A.1 in
Miller's cobordism notes.

If we had some unpointed \$G\$-space \(Y\), we can define the homotopy orbits of \(Y\)
as \(Y_{hG} := EG\times_G Y\). Since \(EG\simeq *\) we get that this is a
"fattened up" version of \(*\times_G Y\). We get a fiber bundle \(Y_{hG}\to
BG\) with fiber \(Y\) and the Serre SS applied to this gives something
called the \emph{homotopy orbit spectral sequence}.

Similarly we can dualize everything to get the homotopy fixed point
spectral sequence. Somehow the dual of \(EG\times_G Y\) is instead to
take \(Y^{hG}:= \textrm{Map}_G(EG,Y)\). Call \(Y^{hG}\) the homotopy fixed
points (which is again a "fattened up" version of \(\textrm{Map}_G(*,Y)
= Y^G\)).

Another thing that came up is the fact that \[H^p(BG; H^q(F))= H^p(G;
H^q(F)). \]
i.e. taking group cohomology. This makes the proof fairly easy since
\(H^0\) is then just fixed points of \(H^q(F)\).
