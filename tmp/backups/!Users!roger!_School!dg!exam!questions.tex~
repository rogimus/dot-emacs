(a)
By Corollary 5.11.b we have
\[ \widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k = \frac{1}{2} \widetilde{g}^{kl}
  \left( \partial_i \widetilde{g}_{jl}
    + \partial_j \widetilde{g}_{il} - \partial_l
    \widetilde{g}_{ij}\right).\]  

Subbing in $\widetilde{g} = e^{2w}g$ gives
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k = & \frac{1}{2} e^{-2w}g^{kl}
  \left( \partial_i e^{2w}g_{jl}
    + \partial_j e^{2w}g_{il} - \partial_l
                              e^{2w}g_{ij}\right) \\
  = &  \frac{1}{2} e^{-2w}g^{kl}
  \big( 2 \partial_iw e^{2w}g_{jl} + e^{2w}\partial_i g_{jl} \\ 
                            &+ 2\partial_j w e^{2w}g_{il} +
                              e^{2w}\partial_j g_{il} \\ 
  & - 2\partial_l w e^{2w} g_{ij} - e^{2w}\partial_l g_{ij}\big)  
\end{align*}
Multiplying through and collecting terms gives
\begin{align*}
  \widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k = & \Gamma_{ij}^{k}+g^{kl}g_{jl}
                                \partial_i w
                                + g^{kl}g_{il}\partial_j w -
                                g^{kl}g_{ij}\partial_l w \\
  =& \Gamma_{ij}^{k}+ \delta_{kj} \partial_i w + \delta_{ki}
     \partial_j w - g^{kl}g_{ij}\partial_l w. 
\end{align*}

Finally, since $\widetilde{\nabla}_{\partial_i} \partial_j =
\widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k\partial_k$, we have precisely that
\begin{align*}
  \widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k\partial_k = &
  \Gamma_{ij}^{k}\partial_k+ \partial_i w \partial_j+ 
                                          \partial_j w \partial_i-
                                          g^{kl}g_{ij}\partial_l w
                                          \partial_k  \\ 
  = & \nabla_{\partial_i}\partial_j + \partial_i w \partial_j+ 
                                          \partial_j w \partial_i-
      g^{kl}g_{ij}\partial_l w \partial_k.
\end{align*}
\\
\noindent
(b)
We have
\begin{align*}
  \widetilde{\textrm{Rm}}(\partial_1,\partial_2,\partial_2,\partial_1)
  = & \widetilde{R}_{1221} \\ = & \widetilde{g}_{1m}(\partial_1
      \widetilde{\Gamma}_{22}^m - \partial_2
      \widetilde{\Gamma}_{12}^m +
                                  \widetilde{\Gamma}_{22}^p\widetilde{\Gamma}_{1p}^m
                                  -
                                  \widetilde{\Gamma}_{12}^p\widetilde{\Gamma}_{2p}^m).
\end{align*}
Using the fact that we are working in normal coordinates for $g$,
we have that $\Gamma_{ij}^{k}=0$ at $p$, and $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ at
$p$. In particular $\widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k$ simplify to
$\delta_{kj}\partial_i w + \delta_{ki}\partial_j w -
\delta_{kl}\delta_{ij}\partial_l w$ and $\widetilde{g}_{ij} =
e^{2w}\delta_{ij}$. Furthermore, we get
\begin{align*}
  \partial_l \widetilde{\Gamma}_{ij}^k =
  \partial_l \Gamma_{ij}^k + \delta_{kj} \partial_l\partial_i w +
  \delta_{ki} \partial_l\partial_j w
  - \delta_{km}\delta_{ij} \partial_l\partial_m w
\end{align*}

Substituting these gives
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{R}_{1221}
  = & e^{2w} g_{11}\Big(\partial_1 \Gamma_{22}^1
      -  \partial_1\partial_1 w
      - \partial_2 \Gamma_{12}^1 - \partial_2\partial_2 w \\
  &
      + (\delta_{p2}\partial_2 w + \delta_{p2}\partial_2 w -
      \delta_{pl}\partial_l w)(
      \delta_{mp}\partial_1 w + \delta_{m1}\partial_p w -
    \delta_{ml}\delta_{1p}\partial_l w) \\ &
    -(\delta_{p2}\partial_1 w + \delta_{p1}\partial_2 w)
    (
      \delta_{mp}\partial_2 w + \delta_{m2}\partial_p w -
                                             \delta_{ml}\delta_{2p}\partial_l w) \Big).
\end{align*}
It's straightforward to check that the terms in the last two lines
cancel out, and we are left with 
\[ \widetilde{R}_{1221} =  e^{2w}g_{11}\Big (\partial_1 \Gamma_{22}^1 - \partial_2 \Gamma_{12}^1
  - \partial_1^2 w - \partial_2^2 w\Big). \]
Using what we already knew about $R$ and $g$ since we are in normal
coordinates around $p$ tells us that this is
\[ \widetilde{R}_{1221}= e^{2w}R_{1221} - e^{2w}(\partial_1^2 w +\partial_2^2 w). \]

\noindent
(c)
We showed in previous homeworks that in a local frame we have $\Delta w =
\partial_1^2 w + \partial_2^2 w$. Thus part (b) says that
$\widetilde{Rm}(\partial_1,\partial_2,\partial_2,\partial_1) =
e^{2w}(K-\Delta w)$.

Simply plugging in and using our
normal coordinates gives
\[ \widetilde{Rm}(\partial_1,\partial_2,\partial_2,\partial_1)
  = \widetilde{K}(e^{4w}-0). \]
Equating these gives \[ \Delta w + \widetilde{K} e^{2w} = K. \]








\subsection*{Question 4}

Let $p$ be some point in $M$. Let $\kappa$ be the sectional curvature
of $(M,g)$ at $p$. By (b) it is enough to find $w$ in some
small geodesic ball $U$ around $p$ such that $\Delta w = \kappa$ since then
we must have $\widetilde{\kappa}e^{2w(p)}=0$ and since
$e^{2w(p)}\neq 0$, we must have that $\widetilde{\kappa}^\prime =
0$. This would then say that $(U,e^{2w}g)$ is flat, as required.
Since $\kappa$ is smooth on $M$, then proposition 1 given in the
problem says that such a $w$ exists. Thus any two-dimensional
Riemannian manifold is locally conformally flat!







\subsection*{Question 5}
\phantom{ }\\
\noindent
(a) For identity, simply take $c$ to be the constant curve on a point
$p\in M$. This follows since composing a smooth curve with $c$ gives
back the original smooth curve (where we can compose on either side).

The group $\textrm{Hol}(M,p)$ is clearly closed since if $c_1$ and
$c_2$ are closed piecewise smooth curves with endpoints $p$, then
$c_1 * c_2$ is also a piecewise smooth closed curve with endpoints
$p$. (There is some messing with the interval of definition that one
should probably do here, i.e. $c_1*c_2$ is defined on
$[a_1,b_1+(b_2-a_2)]$ where we do $c_1(t)$ for $a_1\leq t\leq b_1$
and $c_2(t-b_1+a_2)$ on $b_1\leq t\leq b_1+(b_2-a_2)$.)

Associativity follows since $c_1*(c_2*c_2)=(c_1*c_2)*c_3$. 

Finally, for inverse, we observed in class (see page 108 of Lee) that
parallel transport $P_{t_0t_1}^\gamma(v)$ has an inverse
(namely $P_{t_1t_0}^\gamma(v)$). Now if $c$ is a closed piecewise
smooth curve with endpoints at $p$, then it's reverse path $-c$ is
too. Thus, since $P_{t_1t_0}^c(v) = P_{t_0t_1}^{-c}(v)$ we have that
$P_{-c}$ is the inverse to $P_c$ (under both left and right
composition).\\
\\
\noindent
(b)
Parallel transport along a curve is linear. This follows by looking at
equation 4.19 of Lee, the equation of parallelism in local
coordinates. Furthermore it's an isomorphism, and is hence an element
of $GL_n(T_pM)$. By (a) this means $\textrm{Hol}(M,p)$ is a subgroup
of $GL_n(T_pM)$. Finally observe that Prop 5.5.f of Lee says that
parallel transport is actually an isometry. Hence $\textrm{Hol}(M,p)$
is actually a subgroup of $O(T_pM)$.
