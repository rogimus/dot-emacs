#+title: singular homology
#+filetags: :topology:singular homology:

* Definitions
** algebraic
   
   We can define the singular [[id:5C65D275-0063-4000-8BA2-652B84716A25][chain complex]] of
   a space \(X\in \textrm{Top}\) as
   \[ C_n^{sing}(X) := \mathbb{Z} \textrm{Map}(\Delta^n, X) \]
   where \(\Delta^n\) is the [[id:68899120-085D-4F0E-B52F-92AB0D2933A0][standard n-simplex]]. The boundary map is the
   alternating sum of \(d_i\) where \(d_i\) is induced by precomposition
   with \(\delta^i\),
   \[ \partial_n:= \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i d_i. \]
   /Singular homology/ is the homology of this chain complex:
   \[ H_n(X):= H_n(C_\bullet^{sing}(X)). \]
** geometric

   Geometrically, singular homology of a space \(X\in\textrm{Top}\)
   is defined as bordism but replacing \(n\)-manifolds with
   \(n\)-dimensional ([[id:44E9ABC2-817D-40F7-8E69-458C22ECD0F4][oriented]]) )(\(\Delta\)-complexes. In
   particular
   \[H_n(X)=\{K\xrightarrow{f} X \quad| \quad K\textrm{ is an oriented }n-\textrm{dimensional }\Delta-\textrm{complex without boundary and }f\textrm{ is continuous.}\}/\sim\]
   where the equivalence relation is bordism:
   - \((K,f)\sim (K^\prime,f^\prime)\) if there exists an
     oriented \((n+1)\)-dimensional \(\Delta\)-complex \(L\)
     with boundary \(K\sqcup K^\prime\) and a continuous map
     \(h:L\to X\) which restricts to \(f\sqcup f^\prime\)
     on the boundary. 

** equivalence of definitions

   The idea is that we can find maps between the two showing that
   they are isomorphic. For geometric -> algebraic
   send an oriented \(n\)-simplex in
   the geometric definition to the sum of maps in making up its
   orientation class.

   We can show that if there is a cobordism between two
   \(n\)-simplexes, the this cobordism maps under \(\partial_{n+1}^{sing}\) to
   the sum of the orientation class on one boundary component
   minus the other. In particular the two complexes are equivalent
   in the algebraic definition.

   The map algebraic -> geometric wasn't given but we claimed
   there exists a \((n+1)\)-complex with boundary the thing we need.

*** TODO explain why the map algebraic -> geometric exists ^^

* Properties

** Functorality

    Let \(f:X\to Y\) be continuous.
    For the geometric picture, functorality is easy.
    Simply post-compose and the boundary is preserved.

    For the algebraic picture, we again postcompose.
    We have to check though that the map \(f\) induces
    a map of chain complexes. This is easy though since
    \[ \partial_n f_n (x)= \sum_{i=0^n} d_i(f(x)), \]
    and
    \[ f_{n-1} \partial_n(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_{n-1}(d_i(x))
    = \sum_{i=0}^n f(d_i(x)), \]

** homotopy invariance
