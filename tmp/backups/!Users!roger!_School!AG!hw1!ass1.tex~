\begin{question}
  Give an example of a non-noetherian topological space.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
  Take the space $\bbR$ with the usual topology. Consider the
  descending chain defined by
  $$\bbR= X_0\supsetneq X_1 \supsetneq X_2 \supseteq \cdots$$ where
  $X_i$ is defined as the interval $[-\frac{1}{i},\frac{1}{i}]$ for
  $i\geq 1$. This chain does not stabilize, i.e. given an arbitrary
  $n\in \mathbb{N}$
  $$ \left[-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n}\right] \supsetneq
  \left[-\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n+1}\right]. $$
\end{answer}

% Question 2 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
  Let $k$ be a field which is not algebraically closed. Prove that
  there is some $n$ and an ideal
  $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq k[x_1, \ldots , x_n] $ such that
  $I(Z(\mathfrak{a})) \neq \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
  Since $k$ is not algebraically closed there exists a polynomial
  $f(x)\in k[x]$ of degree strictly greater than 1 which has no roots
  in $k$.  Then in $\bbA^1$ we have that
  $I(Z(f))=I(\emptyset)=k[x]$. Note that since $f(x)$ is irreducible,
  the ideal $(f(x))$ is maximal. In particular it is prime, and thus
  also radical. Finally, we observe that $(f(x))\neq k[x]$.

  
\end{answer}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 3 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question} (I.1.2) \emph{The Twisted Cubic Curve.} Let
  $ Y\subseteq \bbA^3$ be the set
  $Y = \{(t,t^2,t^3 )\,\,|\,\,t\in k\}$.  Show that $Y$ is an affine
  variety of dimension 1. Find generators for the ideal $I(Y)$. Show
  that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over
  $k$. We say that $Y$ is given by the parametric representation
  $x = t, y = t^2, z = t^3$.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
  First observe that clearly $Y=Z(x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)$. Taking the
  ideal of both sides gives
  \[I(Y) = \sqrt{(x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)}.\] In order to show that
  $I(Y)=(x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)$ we prove that
  $k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/ (x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)\cong k[t]$. This is a domain
  and this will allow us to conclude that $(x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)$ is
  prime and therefore also radical.

  To see that $k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/ (x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)\cong k[t]$
  consider two homomorphisms. The first
  $$\varphi:k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/ (x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)\to k[t]$$ is defined by
  \begin{align*}
    &x_1\mapsto t\\
    &x_2\mapsto t^2\\
    &x_3\mapsto t^3.
  \end{align*}
  The second $$\psi:k[t]\to k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/ (x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)$$ is
  defined by $t\mapsto x_1$. Then
  \[ \psi\circ\varphi(f(x_1,x_2,x_3)) = \psi (f(t,t^2,t^3)) =
    f(x_1,x_1^2,x_1^3)\] where the last polynomial is congruent to
  $f(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ in $k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/ (x_1^2-x_2,x_1^2-x_3)$.
  Similarly
  \[ \varphi\circ\psi(f(t)) = \varphi(f(x_1)) = f(t). \] They're also
  clearly well-defined and ring homomorphisms. Thus they are ring
  isomorphisms.

  The final thing to show is that $\dim Y=1$. This follows from
  Proposition I.1.7 of Hartshorne which says that $\dim Y=\dim A(Y)$
  and the fact that $\bbA^1_k$ has dimension 1 (which we showed in
  class on Friday week 1).
\end{answer}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 4 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
  Let $X$ be an algebraic set. Prove that the dimension of $X$ is the
  maximum dimension of an irreducible component of $X$.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
  Consider an arbitrary descending chain
  $X_1\supseteq X_2 \supseteq \cdots$ contained in $X$. Since $X$ is
  an algebraic set we can write $X$ uniquely as the finite union of
  closed irreducible affine varieties $Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$ none of which
  are contained in any other.

  We immediately have that $\max_i\{\dim Z_i\}\leq \dim X$. To see
  this observe that any descending chain contained entirely in one of
  the $Z_i$ is also a descending chain in $X$. In particular a
  descending chain in $Z_i$ of length greater than $\dim X$ would
  contradict the maximality of $\dim X$.

  We now prove the reverse inequality.  The descending chain
  $X_1\supseteq X_2 \supseteq \cdots$ gives rise to $n$ descending
  chains, $Y_1^i\supseteq Y_2^i\supseteq \cdots$ where
  $Y^i_j=X_j\cap Z_i$. Note that each $Y_j^i$ is closed in $X$
  (intersection of two closed sets is closed). Since the $Z_i$ cover
  $X$ we have that $\cup_i Y^i_j = X_j$. Thus, clearly, if all the
  $Y^i_j$ stabilize for every $i$ then $X_j$ must stabilize too. In
  particular $\dim X\leq \max_i\{\dim Z_i\}$.
\end{answer}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 5 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question} (I.1.3+\emph{extra}) Let $Y$ be the algebraic set in
  $\bbA^3$ defined by the two polynomials $x^2 -yz$ and $xz - x$. Show
  that $Y$ is a union of three irreducible components. Describe them
  and find their prime ideals.

  \emph{Extra.} In addition, what is the dimension of Y
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  Observe that $xz-x = x(z-1)$. In particular a point in $\bbA^3$
  vanishes on $xz-z$ precisely if it vanishes on $x$ or on $z-1$, i.e.
  $Z(x(z-1))= Z(x)\cup Z(z-1)$. Hence we wish to find
  \[ Z(x^2-yz)\cap (Z(x)\cup Z(z-1))=\left(Z(x^2-yz)\cap Z(x)\right)
    \cup \left(Z(x^2-yz)\cap Z(z-1)\right).\]

  Consider first $Z(x^2-yz)\cap Z(x)$. This is equal to
  $Z((x^2-yz,x)) = Z(yz,x)$ since the ideal generated by $x^2-yz$ and
  $x$ is equivalent to the ideal generated by $yz$ and $x$. Next
  observe that
  $Z(x^2-yz)\cap Z(z-1) = Z((x^2-yz,z-1)) = Z((x^2-y,z-1))$.  This
  last equality follows since $x^2-yz+y(z-1)=x^2-y$.

  The next step is to observe that
  $Z(yz,x)=Z(yz)\cap Z(x) = Z(x)\cap(Z(y)\cup Z(z))$. Thus we may
  write $Y$ as
  \[ Y = Z(x,y)\cup Z(x,z)\cup Z(x^2-y, z-1). \] These look like the
  sets $\{(0,0,z)\},$ $\{(0,y,0)\}$, and $\{(x,x^2,1)\}$ respectively.

  To show each of these three algebraic sets are irreducible we find
  their ideals and show that they are prime. Since
  $I(Z(\mathfrak{a})) = \sqrt(\mathfrak{a})$ we can reduce our problem
  to finding the radicals of the ideals $(x,y)$, $(x,z)$, and
  $(x^2-y,z-1)$. Since being prime implies being radical, and since we
  want to show primeness anyway, we instead just prove primeness.

  % Seeing that $(x,y)$ and $(x,z)$ are radical is easy. Indeed if
  % $f^r$ is in $(x,y)$ then $f^r = g\cdot x^iy^j$ for $i,j$ not both
  % zero. WLOG we may assume that $g$ is not divisible by either $x$
  % nor $y$.  Since $k[x,y]$ is a UFD we can write
  % $f=x^sy^tp_1\cdots p_n$ for some irreducible polynomials
  % $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ such that neither $x$ nor $y$ divides any of the
  % $p_i$. Then $f^r = x^{rs}y^{rt}p_1^r\cdots p_n^r$. Since neither
  % $g$ nor any of the $p_i$ are divisible by $x$ or $y$ we have that
  % $i=rs$ and $j=rt$. Thus we must have $rs$ and $rt$ are not both
  % zero, i.e. $s,t$ cannot both be zero. Thus $f\in (x,y)$. The proof
  % for $(x,z)$ is identical.

  The quotient ring $k[x,y,z]/(x,y)$ is isomorphic to $k[z]$ which is
  a domain. In particular $(x,y)$ is prime and thus also
  radical. Similarly for $(x,z)$.

  Next consider $(x^2-y,z-1)$. The quotient $k[x,y,z]/(x^2-y,z-1)$ is
  isomorphic to $k[t]$ via the isomorphism $x\mapsto t$,
  $y\mapsto t^2$, $z\mapsto 1$ with inverse $t\mapsto x$. Again since
  $k[t]$ is a domain, we have that $(x^2-y,z-1)$ is prime, and thus
  also radical.
  
  By Question 4 we only need to find the the dimensions of $Z(x,y)$,
  $Z(x,z)$ and $Z(x^2-y,z-1)$. Proposition I.1.7 of Hartshorne says
  that we can compute these dimensions by considering their coordinate
  ring. By our previous discussion we saw that each coordinate ring is
  isomorphic to $k[t]$. Since $k[t]$ is a principal ideal domain, the
  maximum height of a prime ideal is $1$. (This is easy to see
  algebraically, but we've already seen $\bbA^1$ has dimension 1 so
  Prop I.1.7 again implies this.)
\end{answer}

% Question 6 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
  Let $X$ be an irreducible topological space, and let $U$ be a
  non-empty open subset. Show that $U$ is dense in $X$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  If $U=X$, we're done. Hence suppose $U\neq X$.
  
  We have that $U^c \cup \overline{U}=X$ where $U^c$ denotes the
  complement of $U$ in $X$ and $\overline{U}$ denotes the closure of
  $U$ in $X$. Suppose that $U$ is not dense in $X$. Then
  $\overline{U}\neq X$. Similarly, since $U$ is proper $U^c\neq X$.
  Thus $X$ can be written as the union of two proper and closed
  subspaces. This contradicts the fact that $X$ is irreducible. Thus
  $U$ must be dense in $X$.
\end{answer}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 7 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
  Let $Y$ be an irreducible subspace of a topological space $X$. Then,
  $\overline{Y}$ is also irreducible.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}
  Suppose not. Then there exist closed proper subspaces
  $Y_1,Y_2\subseteq \overline{Y}$ (closed in the subspace topology)
  such that $Y_1\cup Y_2=\overline{Y}$. By the subspace topology these
  correspond to closed subsets $X_1,X_2\subseteq X$, i.e.
  $Y_i=X_i\cap \overline{Y}$. But then the sets $Z_1,Z_2$ defined by
  $Z_i=X_i\cap Y$ are closed in $Y$ and $Z_1\cup Z_2=Y$. We next show
  that each $Z_i$ is actually proper in $Y$ to get a contradiction.

  Suppose that they aren't proper, i.e.  suppose (WLOG) that
  $Z_1=Y$. Then $Y\subseteq X_1$. Since $X_1$ is closed, and
  $\overline{Y}$ is the minimal closed subspace of $X$ containing $Y$,
  we therefore have that $\overline{Y}\subseteq X_1$. But then
  $Y_1=\overline{Y}$ which contradicts our initial assumption that
  $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ were proper in $\overline{Y}$.  Thus $Z_1$ and $Z_2$
  must be proper in $Y$. This contradicts our assumption that $Y$ is
  irreducible. Thus $\overline{Y}$ must be irreducible.

  
\end{answer}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 8 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
  (I.1.11) Let $Y\subseteq \bbA^3$ be the curve given parametrically
  by $x = t^3, y = t^4, z = t^5$. Show that $I(Y)$ is a prime ideal of
  height 2 in $k[x,y,z]$ which cannot be generated by 2 elements. We
  say $Y$ is not a local complete intersection - \emph{cf.}
  (Ex. 2.17).

  [Hint: You may find the following non-standard degree on
  $k[x, y, z]$ useful: Set the degree of a monomial $x^iy^jz^k$ to be
  $3i + 4j + 5k$. For example, with this definition, $x^4 + xyz + y^3$
  would be homogeneous of degree 12.]
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  $Y=\{(t^3,t^4,t^5)\,\,|\,\,t\in k\}$.  Consider a polynomial in
  $f\in I(Y)$, i.e. such that $f(t^3,t^4,t^5)=0$ for all $t\in
  k$. Write $f=\sum_{i,j,k} a_{i,j,k} x^iy^jz^k$ (where only finitely
  many of the $a_{i,j,k}$ are non-zero).  Consider a map
  $k[x,y,z]\to k[t]$ given by $x\mapsto t^3$, $y\mapsto t^4$, and
  $z\mapsto t^5$. Then the image of $f$ under such a map is
  \[  \sum_{i,j,k} a_{i,j,k} t^{3i+4j+5k}. \]
  We may rewrite this as
  \[ \sum_{n} \left(\sum_{3i+4j+5k=n} a_{i,j,k}\right) t^n.\]
  Since $f(t^3,t^4,t^5)=0$ for all $t\in k$, and since nonzero
  polynomials must have finitely many roots in $k$,
  we can conclude that $\sum_{3i+4j+5k=n}
  a_{i,j,k}=0$ for every $n$. (Alternatively: plug in $t=1$.)

  Since the kernel of our homomorphism $k[x,y,z]\to k[t]$ clearly has
  kernel $I(Y)$ this completely classifies polynomials in $I(Y)$.
  To see that $I(Y)$ is prime observe that 

  

  Let us consider some elements of $I(Y)$. We have $x^4-y^3$,
  $x^5-z^3$, and $y^5-z^4$ as obvious candidates.

% Question 9 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
  Let $R\to S$ be a morphism of (commutative) rings. Let $\Mod_R$ and
  $\Mod_S$ be the categories of $R$-modules and $S$-modules,
  respectively. Define a functor $F : \Mod_R \to \Mod_S$ on objects
  via $M \mapsto M \otimes_R S$, and a forgetful functor
  $G : \Mod_S\to \Mod_R$. Prove that $F$ is a left adjoint to $G$
  (i.e. for any $M \in \Mod_R$ and $N \in \Mod_S$, there is a
  isomorphism between the $\Hom$-sets
  $\Hom_{\Mod_S}(FM,N)\cong \Hom_{\Mod_R}(M, GN)$ natural in $M$ and
  $N$ ).
\end{question}

\begin{answer}

  Let $N_R$ denote $GN$. This is the restriction of scalars.

  First we define a map $\alpha:\Hom_S(FM,N)\to\Hom_R(M,N_R)$.  Given
  $\varphi:M\otimes_R S\to N$, define a map $M\to N_R$ by
  $m\mapsto \varphi(m\otimes 1)$.  This is $R$-linear since $\varphi$
  is $S$-linear (and thus also $R$-linear).

  Next define a map $\beta:\Hom_R(M,N_R)\to \Hom_S(FM,N)$. Given an
  $R$-linear homomorphism $\psi:M\to N$ define a map
  $M\otimes_R S\to N$ via $m\otimes s\mapsto s\cdot\psi(m)$. This is
  clearly an $S$-linear homomorphism.

  Let us show these are mutually inverse to one another.  Observe that
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha\left(\beta(\psi)\right)(m) &= \beta(\psi)(m\otimes 1)\\
                                      &= 1\cdot \psi(m) = \psi(m).
  \end{align*}
  Next,
  \begin{align*}
    \beta(\alpha(\varphi))(m\otimes s) & = s\cdot \big(\alpha(\varphi)(m)\big) \\
                                       &= s\cdot \varphi(m\otimes 1) \\
                                       &= \varphi(m\otimes s).
  \end{align*}

  It's easy to see that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are group
  homomorphisms. All that is left to check is naturality.

  Given a $R$-linear map $f:M\to M^\prime$, naturality amounts to
  commutativity of the following:
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
      \Hom_R(M^\prime,N_R)\arrow[d, "f^*"']\arrow[r, "\beta"] &
      \Hom_S(FM^\prime,N)\arrow[d, "f^*\otimes_R \id_S"] \\
      \Hom_R(M,N_R)\arrow[r, "\beta"] & \Hom_S(FM,N)
    \end{tikzcd}\] where $f^*$ denotes precomposition with $f$.  Let
  $\psi\in \Hom_R(M^\prime, N_R)$, and let $m\in M$, and $s\in S$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \beta\circ f^*(\psi) (m\otimes s)  &= s\cdot f^*(\psi)(m)\\ 
                                       &= s\cdot \psi(f(m))
  \end{align*}
  On the other hand,
  \begin{align*}
    (f^*\otimes \id_S)\big(\beta (\psi)\big)(m\otimes s)
    & = \beta(\psi)(f(m)\otimes s) \\
    &= s \cdot \psi(f(m)).
  \end{align*}
  Thus $\beta$ is natural in $M$.

  To see naturality in $N$ suppose we have an $S$-linear homomorphism
  $g: N\to N^\prime$.  We wish to show that
  \[\beta\circ g_*(\psi)(m^\prime \otimes s)
    = g_*\circ \beta(\psi)(m^\prime \otimes s)\] where $g_*$ denotes
  post-composition with $g$ and where $\psi\in \Hom_R(M,N_R)$.  The
  RHS equates to
  $g(\beta(\psi)(m^\prime\otimes s)) = g(s\cdot \psi(m^\prime))$. The
  LHS meanwhile equates to
  $s\cdot g_*(\psi)(m^\prime)= s\cdot g(\psi(m^\prime))$. By
  $S$-linearity of $g$ we have LHS=RHS.

  Next we check naturality of $\alpha$. %aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  Naturality in $M$ is equivalent to the following equality holding:
  \[ f^*\circ \alpha (\phi)(m) = \alpha\circ (f_*\otimes \id_S)
    (\phi)(m).\] The LHS becomes
  $\alpha(\phi)(f(m))=\phi(f(m)\otimes 1)$.  Meanwhile the RHS becomes
  $(f\otimes\id_S)_*(\phi)(m\otimes 1) = \phi(f(m)\otimes 1)$.

  Naturality in $N$ is equivalent to the following equality holding:
  \[ g_*\circ \alpha(\phi)(m) = \alpha\circ g_*(\phi)(m).\] The LHS
  comes out to be $g(\alpha(\phi)(m))=g(\phi(m\otimes 1))$, meanwhile
  the RHS is $g_*(\phi)(m\otimes 1) = g(\phi(m\otimes 1))$.
\end{answer}
