* Explain why the ANSS is strictly stronger than the ASS

(Spareness+Miller square?)

There is a trigraded Cartan-Eilenberg/Mahowald spectral sequence
converging to the Adams E_2 page. Likewise there is a trigraded
spectral sequence called the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence
converging to the AN E_2 page. The E_2 page of the former coincides
with the E_1 page for the latter.  Moreover when p>2 the
Cartan-Eilenberg collapses at the E_2 page, and thus is simply a
re-indexed version of the Adams E_2 page. Thus the ANSS is a refinement
of the ASS along the algNSS.

* why BP > MU?

_MU_

For formal reasons we know $\eta_R:\pi_* MU\to MU_*MU$ exists, and we
even know what it looks like on generators when we pass to
$\pi_* MU\otimes \mathbf{Q}$. However we don't know what $\eta_R$ looks
like on the generators for $\pi_* MU$ as a
$\mathbf{Z}-\text{algebra}$.

_BP_

Using the Araki (or Hazewinkel) formulas we can explicitly describe
the generators for $v_i$ for $\pi_* BP$ in terms of the generators for
$\pi_*BP \otimes \mathbf{Q}$.  Then since we have explicit formulas for
$\eta_R$ on these generators over $\mathbf{Q}$, we get explicit
formulas for the $v_i$. This allows us to easily find differentials in
the cobar complex for $BP$ and $BP/I_n$, etc. For example the first
differential in the cobar complex for $BP/I_1$
