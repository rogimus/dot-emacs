My last meeting was Friday, and this weeks is Wednesday, so I haven't
had much time to prepare, especially since I was away in Michigan over
the weekend.

I've been trying to learn about two things over the past few
days. Firstly is the construction of the steenrod squares. And
secondly is about the dual steenrod algebra.

** Constructing the Steenrod Squares.

We write $H^i(X)$ for $H^i(X;\mathbb{F}_2)$ throughout. 

We only deal with the case $n=2$. Given any pointed space $X$ we form a filtration
$F_0 X^2 = \{ *\}\subset F_1 X^2 = X\vee X \subset F_2 X^2 = X\times X$. We
abbreviate $F_k X$ to $F_k$. Note that more generally
$F_k X^n = \{
(x_1,\ldots, x_n) | \text{ at least }n-k\text{ points are the
basepoint}\}$.
Clearly $\Sigma_2$ acts on this filtration by permuting $X^n$. Recall
that $S^\infty\to \mathbb{R}P^\infty$ is the classifying bundle for
$\Sigma_2$. Next we
define the pointed homotopy quotient of $X^n$ by $\Sigma_2$ to be
\[ D_{\Sigma_2} X= S^\infty\times_{\Sigma_2} X^2 / (S^\infty
\times_{\Sigma_2} X^{\vee 2})\]
where $S^\infty \times_{\Sigma_2} Y$ is the *borel construction* which
identifies $(eg,y)\sim (e,gy)$ in $E\Sigma_2 \times Y$.
Note that $D_{\Sigma_2} X \cong S^\infty \times_{\sigma} X^{\wedge
2}$.
Using some relative Serre SS we obtain the following Lemma:

Given $X$ such that $\widetilde{H}^i(X;\mathbb{F}_2)=0$ for all $i<q$,
and $\widetilde{H}^q(X)$ is finite dimensional, then
$\widetilde{H}^i(D_{\Sigma_2} X)=0$ for $i<2q$ and
$\widetilde{H}^{2q}(D_{\Sigma_2} X) = \textrm{Sym}^2(H^q(X))$.

In the case of $X=K(\mathbb{F}_2,q)$ we obtain, by the Hurewicz theorem that
\[H^{2q}(D_2 K) = \textrm{Sym}^2(\mathbb{F}_2) \cong \mathbb{F}_2.\]
From the proof of the lemma we can conclude that the fiber inclusion
$K\wedge K \to D_2 K$ induces an isomorphism on cohomology. Next note
that by a relative version of the Kunneth theorem (see Hatcher 3.18)
we have that $H^{2q}(K\wedge K)$ is generated by $\iota_q\otimes
\iota_q$ where $\iota_q$ is the generator for $H^q(K)$.
Thus there is some element $P\in H^{2q}(D_2 K)$ such that $i^* P =
\iota_q\otimes \iota_q$.

Given an arbitrary $X$ and $u\in H^q(X)$, note that $u$ is represented
by a (homotopy class of a) map $u:X\to K$.  We can consider $1\wedge
u\wedge u$ on $D_2 X$.
We get a cohomology class obtained as the pushforward of $P$ along 
$D_2 u$. The pushforward of this along $i$ is $u\wedge u$,
i.e. $i^*(D_2 u^*(P))$. This follows by considering the maps these
classes represent between spaces.

Thinking of $X$ as having a trivial $\Sigma_2$ action we get a map $j$
from $B\Sigma_2 \phantom{}_+\wedge X\to D_2 X$ which is just $1\wedge
\Delta$.
Again by our relative Kunneth theorem we have
\[H^*(B\Sigma_2\wedge X) \cong\mathbb{F}_2[x]\otimes H^*(X),\]
recalling that $B \Sigma_2 \cong \mathbb{R}P_n$.
Then
\[ j^*P = \sum_{i=-q}^q x^{q-i}\otimes \textrm{Sq}^i u\]
for some class $\textrm{Sq}^i u \in H^{q+i}(X)$. These define the
Steenrod squares.

*** Questions about the construction

 - cohomology represented by $K(G,q)$?
 - intuition for classifying spaces? I have trouble picturing anything
   beyond the words "geometric realization"
 - Intuition for borel construction?
 - Fiber inclusion?


** Dual Steenrod Algebra



We define $\xi_i\in \mathcal{A}_*:=
\textrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{F}_2}(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{F}_2)$
on $\theta \in \mathcal{A}$ as the coefficient of $x^{2^i}$ of
$\theta(x)$. This actually allows us to completely determine $\theta$
as 
\[\theta x = \sum_i \langle \theta, \xi_i\rangle x^{2^i}. \]
The reason for this is that $Sq(x^{2^i})=(x+x^2)^{2^i} \equiv x^{2^i}+
x^{2^{i+1}}$ mod 2.
Thus $Sq^0$ and $Sq^{2^i}$ are the only nonzero squares on $x^{2i}$.
Thus, inductively, $\theta$ is determined by the formula given above.

It turns out that these generate $\mathcal{A}_*$.

*THM:* The obvious map
\[ \mathbb{F}_2[\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots] \xrightarrow{\beta}
\mathcal{A}_*\]
is an isomorphism.

The proof of this is some argument using some Euler class.
