\section{L12 - $\KK$-theory of finite fields III}

``We've been fighting a battle -- a battle against the $\KK$-theory of
finite fields.''

Let's recap. Let $q=p^n$ for some $n$. Our main diagram looks like

\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \coprod_{n\geq }\mathrm{B}GL_n(\bF_q)\arrow[r]\arrow[dr,
    dotted]\arrow[d]&\BU\times \bZ \arrow[d]\arrow[r, "\psi^q-1"]&\BU\times \bZ\\
    \underline{\KK(\bF_q)}\arrow[r,dotted,"\varphi"']&\mathrm{F}\psi^q&
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Since the composite of the top row is zero we obtain the diagonal map
(i.e. we have to factor through the fibre of the top right map).  The
{\bf overal strategy} is to find $\varphi$ such that the diagonal map
factors through $\varphi$ and such that $\varphi$ is an
$\HH_*$-isomorphism. Then since it an $\HH_*$-isomorphism between
$\HH_*$-local spaces, it is a $\pi_*$-isomoprhism. But we know we know
$\pi_*\mathrm{F}\psi^q$.

We know $\pi_*\mathrm{F}\psi^q$ has no $p$-torsion, so in order to
show the $\varphi$ we cook up is a homology isomorphism, we need to
check three things:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item it's a rational equivalence (easy),
\item it's a homology isomorphism mod $l$ for $l\neq p$ a prime,
\item and $\underline{\KK(\bF_q)}$ has no mod $p$-homology.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{classquestion}
  Do we know why the top composite is zero?
\end{classquestion}
\begin{answer}
  Quick confidence check: Suppose you have a map $G\to
  \bF_q^\times$. This is easy to take the Brauer lift of: simply post
  compose with the inclusion
  $G\to\bF_q^\times\hookrightarrow\bC^\times$. This is some character
  $g\mapsto \chi(g)$. Associated to this complex character is a
  complex line bundle $L_\chi\to \BB G$. {\color{orange} what I said
    here might not be right: We obtain this line bundle in two
    steps. First take classifying spaces to obtain a map
    $\BB G\to \BB \bC^\times$ and observe that both $\BB \bC^\times$
    and $\CP^\infty$ are $\mathrm{K}(\bZ,2)$s and thus are homotopy
    equivalent. Second pull back the universal line bundle on
    $\CP^\infty$. Instead Mark says given $G$-representation $V$ take
    $\mathrm{E}G\times_G V\to \BB G$.} Then $\psi^q$ send $L_\chi$ to
  $L_\chi^{\otimes q}\to \BB G$ which is otherwise known as
  $L_{\chi^q}$. But $\chi(g)^q=\chi(g)$ since $\chi(g)$ is in the
  image of $\bF_q^\times$ and the $q$-th Frobenius acts via the
  identity. Thus the $q$-th Adams operation is the identity on
  $L_\chi$.
\end{answer}


We found the homology of a connected component of
$\mathrm{F}\psi^q$. In particular for $l\neq p$ we have
\[
  \HH_*\left(\mathrm{F}\psi^q_0\,;\,\bZ/l\right)\cong
  \bZ/l\,[\,\xi_{2ir}\,|\,i\geq 1]\otimes
  \Lambda_{\bZ/l}[\,\eta_{2ir-1}\,|\,i\geq 1].
\]
We'll show that these generators actually came from the top left
corner.

We chose $r$ such that $\bF_{q^r}=\bF_q(\zeta_l)$ where $\zeta_l$ is a
primitive root of unity of order $l$. This is a Galois extension over
$\bF_q$ with Galois group $C_r$ (acting via the Frobenius). We have
$\bF_{q^r}^\times = C_{q^r-1}$. Since $\bF_{q^r}$ can be embedded
uniquely (up to conjugation) into $GL_r(\bF_q)$ {\color{orange}(why?
  how? I don't understand enough rep th over finite fields to see why
  this is obvious)} there is an embedding of $C_{q^r-1}$ into
$GL_r(\bF_q)$.  We also have an obvious multiplication action of
$\bF_{q^r}^\times$ on $\bF_{q^r}$. Furthermore we can extend this
embedding along the action of the Galois group to get a realisation of
$C_r\ltimes C_{q^r-1}$ in $GL_r(\bF_q)$ {\color{blue} (this is a fun
  exercise)}, which tells us that an element of $C_r$ gives rise to an
inner automorphism of $GL_r(\bF_q)$, i.e. an action via
conjugation. So outer automorphisms of $C_{q^r-1}$ from $C_r$ become
inner automorphisms of $GL_r(\bF_q)$!

So the homomorphism
\[\HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\bZ/l)\to \HH_*(\B\GL_r(\bF_q);\bZ/l)\] factors
through the Galois coinvariants
$\HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\bZ/l)_{\mathrm{Gal}}$. This is because inner
automorphisms act via the identity on group cohomology, and so any
$x\in \HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\,\bZ/l)$ will get identified with the orbit
$C_r\cdot x$ in $\HH_*(\BB GL_r(\bF_q);\,\bZ/l)$. {\color{teal} I need
  to read more of Brown's book...}

Note that since $l$ divides $q^r-1$ {\color{teal}(``elementary
  computation'')} then $\HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\,\bZ/l)$ is isomoprhic to
$\bZ/l\{\beta_i\}$ for $i=*$. The Galois action is relatively easy to
compute. It follows from the fact that $c_1(L^{\otimes q})=qc_1(L)$
and that $\beta_2$ is dual to a $c_1$ (which you can figure out
apparently by taking the canonical representation of $C_{q^r-1}$ and
then taking the associated line bundle then observing that $\HH_2$ is
dual to $\HH^2$ which is generated by the first Chern class of that
line bundle). It follows then that
$\mathrm{Frob}_q:\beta_2\mapsto q\beta_2$. The class in $H_1$ and
$H_2$ are related by a Bockstein, which allows us to deduce further
that $\beta_1\mapsto q\beta_1$. And since $c_1^i\mapsto q^i c_1$ we
can further deduce that
$\mathrm{Frob}_q:\beta_{2i}\mapsto q^i\beta_{2i}$ and another
Bockstein argument allows you to deduce that
$\beta_{2i-1}\mapsto q^i\beta_{2i-1}$. Since $l$ is coprime to $q$
then taking coinvariants in degree $2i$ and $2i-1$ (i.e. quotienting
by $q^i-1$) is zero except for in degrees $2ir$ and $2ir-1$ (since $l$
is minimal with the property that $q^r-1\equiv 0$ mod $l$). So we get
\[
  \HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\bZ/l)_{\mathrm{Gal}}=
  \begin{cases}
    \bZ/l&*=2ir,\,\,2ir-1\\
    0&\text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\]

{\bf Next:} need to compute $\HH_*(\coprod_n \GL_n(\bF_q))$. The
diagonal map of the original diagram is almost a
$\HH_*$-isomorphism. We're gonna find a bunch of generators that map
to the $\xi_{2ir}$'s and the $\eta_{2ir-1}$'s.

Under \[\HH_*(C_{q^r-1};\bZ/l)\to \HH_*(\B\GL_r(\bF_q);\bZ/l)\] the
$\beta_{2ir}$ and $\beta_{2ir-1}$ map to classes we call $\xi_{2ir}$
and $\xi_{2ir-1}$. We give them these names because after mapping through to
the homology of $\mathrm{F}\psi^q$ these are the classes they hit.
