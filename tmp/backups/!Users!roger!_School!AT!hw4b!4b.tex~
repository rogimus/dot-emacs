\subsection*{Question 1}
\label{sec:orgb146f1a}

Compute \(\Tor_1^{\bbZ} (\bbZ/n, \bbZ/m)\).

\begin{proof}
A projective resolution for \(\bbZ/n\) is the following:
\[ 0 \to \bbZ \xrightarrow{\times n} \bbZ\to \bbZ/n. \]
Dropping the \(\bbZ/n\) term from the right, and tensoring with
\(\bbZ/m\) gives us a chain complex 
\[ 0 \to \bbZ/m \xrightarrow{\times n} \bbZ/m \to 0. \]
Taking homology gives \(\Tor\) and we see that \(\Tor_1\) is simply the
kernel of the multiplication by \(n\) map from \(\bbZ/m\) to itself.
These are the elements \(a\in \bbZ/m\) such that \(m\) divides \(a\cdot
   n\). These are the integers \(a\) such that \(\gcd(n,m)\) divide \(a\).
In summary, if \(d=\gcd(n,m)\), then
\[ \Tor_1^\bbZ (\bbZ/n, \bbZ/m) = \bbZ/d. \]
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Question 2}
\label{sec:orga9b1ba7}

A map \(f:S^n\to S^n\) satisfying \(f(x)=f(-x)\) for all \(x\in S^n\) is
called an \emph{even map}. Show that every even map \(S^n\to S^n\) must
have even degree, and that the degree must in fact be zero when \(n\) is
even. When \(n\) is odd, show there exist even maps of any given even
degree. [Hint: If \(f\) is even, it factors as a composition \(S^n\to
   \RP^n \to S^n\). Using the computation of \(H_n(\RP^n)\) in
the text, show that the induced map \(H_n(S^n)\to H_n(\RP^n)\)
sends a generator to twice the generator when \(n\) is odd. It may be
useful to show that the quotient map \(\RP^n \to\RP^n /
   \RP^{n-1}\) induces an isomorphism on \(H_n\) when \(n\) is odd.]

\begin{proof}


Following the hint, observe that every even map \(f:S^n\to S^n\)
factors through \(\RP^n\) via the quotient map \(S^n\to \RP^n\). In the case that \(n\) is even, we know
that \(H_n(\RP^n) = 0\). Thus the induced map on homology
\(f_*:H_n(S^n)\to H_n(S^n)\) factors through the trivial group,
and is therefore the zero map.

In the case that \(n\) is odd, we have that \(H_n(\RP^n)=\bbZ\). 
Following the hint, let us show that the quotient map \(q:\RP^n \to
   \RP^n/\RP^{n-1}\) induces an isomorphism on homology. To do this we
observe that \(\RP^{n-1}\) can be constructed as a sub-complex of
\(\RP^n\), i.e. \((\RP^n,\RP^{n-1})\) is a good pair, and thus we can
use the LES of a pair and the fact that
\(\widetilde{H}_i(\RP^n/\RP^{n-1}) \cong H_i(\RP^n,\RP^{n-1})\).
Around degree \(n\) the LES looks like:

\[\begin{tikzcd}
      0\rar& H_n(\RP^{n-1}) \rar & H_n(\RP^n) \rar & H_n(\RP^n,\RP^{n-1})\rar &
       H_{n-1}(\RP^{n-1})\rar & \cdots
   \end{tikzcd}\]

Since \(n\) is odd, then \(H_n(\RP^{n-1})=H_{n-1}(\RP^{n-1})=0\).
In particular this says
\[H_n(\RP^n)\cong H_n(\RP^n,\RP^{n-1})\cong \widetilde{
   H}_n(\RP^n/\RP^{n-1})\] and thus  \(q\) induces  an isomorphism on
homology. (We're intentionally omitting the discussion of \(n=0\) and
\(\widetilde{H}_i (X) =H_i(X)\) for \(i>0\).)

Now \(\RP^n/\RP^{n-1}\simeq D^n/ \partial D^n\) is homotopy
equivalent to \(S^n\). In particular our work thus far has shown that
\(H_n(\RP^n)\cong H_n(S^n)\) for \(n\) odd. Thus the degree of our map
\(f\) is the degree of the map induced by the quotient map \(S^n\to
   \RP^n\) and the map induced by \(\RP^n\to S^n\) sending \([x]\in \RP^n\)
to \(f(x)\). Observe that the quotient map has degree 2. Indeed
choose a regular value \([x]\in \RP^n\), for example the class
represented by the north pole.
Then some small neighbourhood of \([x]\) has preimage two
small open neighbourhoods. One of these is around the north pole,
where we do the identity map on \(T_x S^n\), and the other is around the
south pole, where we apply the map induced by the antipodal map
to \(T_{x} S^n\). This results is a map \(T_{x}S^n\to T_{-x}S^n\) which
is orientation preserving (since \(n\) is odd). Thus the geometric
degree at the north pole is 2. By the proposition proved in class
the geometric degree of \(f\) at a regular point is the same as the
algebraic degree of \(f\),  and thus the degree of \(q\) is 2.

Finally, as we already remarked, the degree of \(f\) is the
multiplication of the degrees of the map quotient map \(S^n\to
   \RP^n\) and the map \(\RP^n \to S^n\) induced by \(f\). Since the degree
of the quotient map is two, we can conclude the degree of \(f\) must
be even. If we take the map \(\RP^n \to S^n\) which induces an
isomorphism on homology (i.e. quotienting by \(\RP^{n-1}\)) then this
gives us a map \(f_2:S^n\to S^n\) of degree 2. Since \(\deg f \circ g =
   \deg f \times \deg g\), by composing \(f_2\) with itself \(n\) times, we
get a map of degree \(2n\). 
\end{proof}
