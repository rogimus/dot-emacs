\item[Grade:] The tutorials for Math 20580 are worth 40 points out of
  the total 550 points available for the class. These points come from
  {\bf quizzes} (10pts) and {\bf worksheets} (30pts).
\item[Quiz:] There will be a quiz every week starting from week two,
  except for the weeks in which there is an exam (week five and
  twelve). The quiz is 10 minutes long and will take place at the
  beginning of class. Typically the quiz will cover content from the
  previous week's worksheet. The quizzes are worth 25\% of your
  tutorial grade. Each quiz is worth 1 point, with the lowest grade
  being dropped from the total at the end of the semester.
\item[Worksheet:] In the remaining 40 minutes of class, students will
  split into small groups and work collaboratively together on a
  worksheet. The worksheet covers recent material from the
  lectures. One worksheet from each group is to be handed in to the TA
  by 5pm the following Friday (with the overall goal for the worksheet
  to be finished by class end). This is to allow for extra time if
  needed while also hopefully preserving your weekend. The worksheets
  are worth 75\% of the tutorial grade. Each worksheet is worth 2.5
  points, with the lowest score being dropped from the total at the
  end of the semester.

\item[Attendance:] This is all mentioned in the general information
  sheet (on the website). To rehash, attendance to tutorials is
  mandatory. An excused absence from class will result in that quiz
  and worksheet not being counted (i.e. they will be considered to be
  worth 0 points).
