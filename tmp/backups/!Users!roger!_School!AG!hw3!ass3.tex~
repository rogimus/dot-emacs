\begin{question}
  Let $Y$ be an algebraic variety over $k$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that for any $P \in Y$, the local ring $\calO_{P,Y}$ is
    a local $k$-algebra (i.e. a $k$-algebra with a unique maximal
    ideal).
  \item Prove that the function field $K(Y)$ is a field extension of
    $k$.
  \item Make the assignments $Y \mapsto \calO(Y)$,
    $Y \mapsto \calO_{P,Y}$ and $Y\mapsto K(Y)$ into functors. More
    specifically, given a morphism $\varphi: Y \to Z$ of varieties,
    construct homomorphisms $\varphi^*: \calO(Z) \to \calO(Y )$,
    $\varphi^*_P : \calO_{\varphi(P),Z}\to \calO_{P,Y}$ and
    $\varphi^* : K(Z) \to K(Y)$ (which are the identity when $\varphi$
    is the identity, and which are compatible with compositions).
  \item Find injective homomorphism
    $\calO(Y) \to \calO_{P,Y} \to K(Y)$ natural in $Y$, i.e. fit into
    a commutative diagram with the homomorphisms from the previous
    part.
  \item Conclude that $\calO(Y)$, $\calO_{P,Y}$ and $K(Y )$ are
    invariants. In particular, $\dim Y$ is a (discrete) invariant of
    $Y$. (For example, if $\varphi: Y \to Z$ is an isomorphism with
    $\varphi(P) = Q$, then $\calO_{P,Y} \cong \calO_{Q,Z}$.)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}


\begin{answer}\phantom{}
  
  (a) As per the discussion the discussion in Harshorne it has a
  maximal ideal $\frakm$ generated by $(U,f)$ where $f(P)=0$.

  We first prove that $\frakm$ is maximal.  Suppose that
  $(U,f)\in \calO_P$ such that $f(P)\neq 0$. Then
  $V = U\cap (U\setminus Z(f))$ is an open set containing $P$ on which
  $f$ doesn't vanish. Thus $(V,1/f)$ is an element of $\calO_P$. Since
  open sets are dense because $Y$ is irreducible, we have that
  $(V,1/f)$ is an inverse for $(U,f)$.  In particular if $\frakm$ is
  the ideal generated by $(W,g)$ for which $g(P)=0$ then
  $\calO_P/\frakm$ is a field.

  Next we prove that $\calO_P/\frakm\cong k$. Indeed observe that, in
  $\calO_P/\frakm$, the equivalence class $(U,f)$ is entirely
  determined by $f(P)$ since if $f(P)=g(P)$ then $f-g\in \frakm$.

  Finally we wish to show that it is the unique maximal ideal. To do
  this we observe that every element not in $\frakm$ is invertible,
  i.e. if we had some maximal ideal $\frakm^\prime\neq \frakm$ then
  there would be some $(U,f)\in \frakm^\prime$ which isn't in
  $\frakm$. But by our earlier argument we have that $(U,f)$ has some
  inverse $(V,1/f)$ in $\calO_P$ and then $\calO_P/\frakm^\prime = 0$,
  a contradiction. (Side remark: I am a fan of the field of 1
  element!)

  (b) This follows again from Hartshorne's discussion and our
  discussion for (a). In particular we have that $(V,1/f)$ is an
  inverse for $(U,f)$ in $K(Y)$ with $V=U\setminus (U\setminus Z(f))$
  using density of opens. We can embed $k$ as a subfield using the
  constant functions, $f_c(P) = c$ for all $P\in Y$.

  (c) Given $(U,f)\in \calO(Z)$ let
  $\varphi^*(U,f) = (\varphi^{-1}(U),f\circ \varphi)\in
  \calO(Y)$. Since $\varphi$ is a morphism, $f\circ\varphi$ is a
  regular function $\varphi^{-1}(U)\to k$.

  You can do very similar things for $\calO_{P,Y}$ and $K(Y)$. These
  are clearly well-defined again since $\varphi$ is a morphism and
  since the equivalence classes have similar definitions. Furthermore
  this is clearly the identity when $\varphi=\id$, and composition of
  morphisms also clearly works.

  (d) The map $\calO(Y)\to \calO_{P,Y}$ is obvious. By definition $f$
  is regular on $Y$ means that $f$ is regular at $P$. It is injective
  since if $r$ is another regular function on $Y$ such that $r=f$ on
  some open subset $P\in V\subset Y$, i.e. $r-f=0$ on $V$. But $V$ is
  dense, and regular functions are determined on dense open
  subsets. To see this observe that $r-f$ is regular, i.e. continous,
  so the inverse image of 0 $\{q\in Y\,\, | \,\, r(q)-f(q)=0\}$ is
  closed, i.e. it is closed and contains a dense open, so it is the
  whole of $Y$. Thus $r=f$ on $Y$.

  The map $\calO_{P,Y}\to K(Y)$ is also obvious. Indeed send $(U,f)$
  to $(U,f)$. The equivalence relation is defined in the same way so
  it is clearly well-defined. It might, however, not be injective
  since we are adding more classes of morphisms, i.e. there could be
  $(U,f)$ and $(V,g)$ in $\calO_{P,Y}$ which suddenly get identified
  by a new class $(W,h)\not\in \calO_{P,Y}$. However this would imply
  that $f-g=0$ on the dense open $V\cap U\cap W$. By an argument
  similar for above this would imply that $f-g=0$ on $V\cap U$ (view
  $V\cap U$ as a quasi-affine, and $V\cap U \cap W$ as a dense open
  subset on which these agree, then the inverse image of $0$ is a
  closed set in $V\cap U$ containing the dense open, i.e. it is the
  whole of $V\cap U$).

  Naturality is easy to check using the maps from (c).

\begin{question}\phantom{}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that any non-empty open set $U$ of a variety $X$ is a
    variety, and the inclusion map $\iota: U \to X$ is a morphism of
    varieties.
  \item Prove that the morphisms $\iota^*: K(X) \to K(U)$ and
    $\iota^*_P : \calO_{X,P} \to \calO_{U,P}$ from the previous
    exercise are isomorphisms. Find an example where
    $\iota^*: \calO(X) \to\calO(U)$ is not an isomorphism.
  \item Use this to compute the function field of $\bbP^n$ (without
    using Theorem I.3.4).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  (a) The first part is an easy definition chase using some basic
  pointset topology.  The second part is easy since if $f$ is regular
  on $V\subset X$ is open then $\iota^{-1}(V)=V\cap U$ and
  $f|_{V\cap U}$ is regular.

  (b) $K(X)\to K(U)$ is clearly surjective. Injectivity is easy too
  since if $(W,f)$ and $(V,g)$ are two regular functions such that
  $(U\cap W\cap V, f) = (U\cap W\cap V, g)$ (where we're omitting
  abusing notation for the restriction maps) then $(W,f)\sim (V,g)$ in
  $K(X)$ by definition.

  A similar argument can be made for $\calO_{P,X}\to \calO_{P,U}$.

  The problem with $\calO(X)\to \calO(U)$ is that these are global
  sections, and global sections can be very restrictive. What allowed
  us to get the previous isomorphisms was only defining things on some
  open set, which doesn't work here. In particular the map might not
  be surjective because we might not be able to realise all sections
  on $U$ as a global section.  Take $U=\bbA^1\setminus 0$ and
  $X=\bbA^1$. We've already seen that $\Gamma(X,\calO)=k[x]$. We have
  also observed that $x^{-1}$ is a section of $U$. It's not hard to
  see that $\Gamma(U,\calO)=k[x,x^{-1}]$, and thus these are not
  isomorphic.

\begin{question}
  Let $Y$ be a quasi-affine variety. Prove that all morphisms
  $\bbP^1 \to Y$ are constant, i.e. map all points in $\bbP^1$ to a
  single point in $Y$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  Recall from I.3.4.a (or from problem 6) that $\calO(\bbP^1)=k$. Then
  by I.3.6 a map $\psi:\bbP^1\to Y\subset \bbA^n$ is a morphism if an
  only if $x_i\circ \psi$ is a regular function on $\bbP^1$ for each
  $i$ where $x_i$ are the coordinate functions on $\bbA^n$. Since
  $\calO(\bbP^1)=k$ we must have that $x_i\circ \psi = c_i$ for some
  constant $c_i\in k$. Thus $\psi$ is regular iff it's constant of the
  form $(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$.

\begin{question}\phantom{}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that $\bbA^1 \setminus 0$ is affine, i.e. isomorphic to
    an affine variety. What is the homomorphism of $k$-algebras
    induced by the inclusion $\bbA^1\setminus 0 \to\bbA^1$?
  \item (Hartshorne I.3.6.) (Prove that $\bbA^2 \setminus 0$ is
    quasi-affine but not affine.)
  \item Prove that $\bbP^2 \setminus [0 : 0 : 1]$ is quasi-projective,
    but neither projective nor quasi-affine (i.e. not isomorphic to a
    quasi-affine or projective variety).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  (a) Consider the map
  $\varphi:\bbA^1\setminus 0 \to Z(xy-1)\subset \bbA^2$ given by
  $t\mapsto (t,t^{-1})$. Then this is an isomorphism. There is an
  obvious inverse $(x,y)\mapsto x$. All we need to check is that these
  are morphisms. We give more of a discussion than a proof.

  Let $f$ be a regular function in $\calO(Z(xy-1))$. On some open
  subset $U$ we have $f=g/h$ for $g,h$ polynomials in $x$ and $y$ such
  that $h\neq 0$ on $U$. The pullback of this is
  $g(x,x^{-1})/h(x,x^{-1})$. This is well-defined on $\varphi^{-1}$
  since $h(t,t^{-1})=0$ if and only if $h(x,y)=0$ for
  $(x,y)=\varphi(t)$. One can similarly check that the inverse is a
  morphism.
  
  The inclusion $\bbA^1\setminus 0 \hookrightarrow \bbA^1$ corresponds
  to a homomorphism $\varphi\in \Hom_{\Alg_k}(k[t],k[x,y]/(xy-1))$ by
  I.3.5. But $k[x,y]/(xy-1)\cong k[x,x^{-1}]$ so the morphism just
  sends $f(t)\mapsto f(x)$.


  (b) Consider $X=\bbA^2\setminus 0 =\bbA^2\setminus Z(x,y)$. A
  regular function on $X$ looks like $f(x,y)/g(x,y)$ with the property
  that $g(s,t)\neq 0$ for all $(s,t)\in X$. But $g(x,0)$ is a
  polynomial in $x$. Since it cannot vanish on any point $(s,0)$ we
  must have that $g(s,0)\neq 0$ for all $s\in k$. This implies
  $g(s,0)$ must be constant. In particular $g(x,y)$ must be a
  polynomial purely in $y$. But, by the same reasoning it must again
  be constant. Thus $g(x,y)$ is constant. From this we can conclude
  that $\calO(X)= k[x,y]$. {\color{red} From this we can conclude that
    $X$ is affine if and only if $X$ isomorphic to $\bbA^2$ (by I.3.7
    which says affine varieties are isomorphic iff their coordinate
    rings are and I.3.2.a which says for affine varieties
    $\calO(Y)\cong A(Y)$). This is clearly not true, since they aren't
    homemorphic.}

\begin{question}
  Prove that regular functions on $\bbP^1$ are regular functions on
  the two basic affine open sets $U_0$ and $U_1$ which agree on the
  overlap $U_0 \cap U_1$. Use this to give a proof of the fact that
  all regular functions on $\bbP^1$ are constant.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  This is a special case of Theorem I.3.4.a. The proof is
  straightforward. I think the hardest part of the proof of this theorem is convincing yourself
  that $A=k[X_0,X_1]_{(X_1)}\cong k[t]$. One direction
  ($k[t]\to k[X_0,X_1]_{(X_1)}$) is easy. The other direction follows
  because if we have some polynomial $f\in A$ then, if $d$ is the
  highest degree of $X_0$ occurring, we may homogenize $f$
  w.r.t. $X_1$ to get $F$ of degree $d$ (we can use highest degree of
  $X_0$ since we have $X_1^{-1}$). Then $F/X_1^d$ is a polynomial in
  $X_0/X_1$. To see this observe that any term $X_0^mX_1^n$ goes to
  $X_0^m X_1^{d-m}$ and thus
  \[ \frac{X^m_0 X_1^{d-m}}{X_1^d} = \frac{X_0^m}{X_1^m}.\] Then we
  may write $f=X_0^d+f(X_0,X_1) + X_1^d$. Thus we may send
  $f(X_0,X_1)$ to the polynomial $G(t)$ where $G$ is the polynomial
  $F/X_1^d$ in $X_0/X_1$. It isn't hard to see that this is a
  bijection, moreover an isomorphism.

  The final ingredient is to show that if $f$ is regular on $U_0$ and
  $g$ is regular on $U_1$ and they agree on $U_1\cap U_0$, then
  $f=g=c$ for some constant $c\in k$. To see this simply observe that
  on the overlap we must have
  $f(t)=f(X_1/X_0)=g(X_0/X_1)=g(t^{-1})$. Then the statement follows
  for degree reasons.

  (Hartshorne I.3.17. - \emph{Normal Varieties}) A variety is
  \emph{normal at a point} $P\in Y$ if $\calO_P$ is an integrally
  closed ring. $Y$ is \emph{normal} if it is normal at every point.

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Show that every conic in $\bbP^2$ is normal.
  \item Show that the quadric surfaces $Q_1,Q_2$ in $\bbP^3$ given by
    equations $Q_1: xy=zw;$ $Q_2:xy=z^2$ are normal (cf (ex II.6.4)).
  \item Show that the cuspidal cubic $y^2=x^3$ in $\bbA^2$ is not
    normal.
  \item If $Y$ is affine, then $Y$ is normal $\iff$ $A(Y)$ is
    integrally closed.
  \item Let $Y$ be an affine variety. Show that there is a normal
    affine variety $\widetilde{Y}$, and a morphism
    $\pi:\widetilde{Y}\to Y$ with the property that, whenver $Z$ is a
    normal variety and $\varphi:Z\to Y$ is a \emph{dominant} morphism
    (i.e. $\varphi(Z)$ is dense in $Y$), then there is a unique
    morphism $\theta:Z\to \widetilde{Y}$ such that
    $\varphi = \pi\circ \theta$. We call $\widetilde{Y}$ the
    \emph{normalization} of $Y$. (This needs (ex I.3.9A).)

\begin{answer}
  (a) what is a conic?

  (b)

  (c) We have $A(Y)= k[x,y]/(x^3-y^2)$.
  
  (d) $Y$ is normal $\iff$ $\calO_P$ integrally closed for all $P\in
  Y$. By I.3.2.b this is true $\iff$ $A(Y)_{\frakm_P}$ is integrally
  closed where $\frakm_P$ is the maximal ideal corresponding to $P$
  under the nullstellensatz. Thus we have reduced our problem to the
  equivalent statement: $A(Y)$ integrally closed $\iff$
  $A(Y)_{\frakm_P}$ integrally closed for all maximal ideals $\frakm_P\in A(Y)$.
