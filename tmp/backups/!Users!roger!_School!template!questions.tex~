\subsection*{Question 1}
{\bf [Hatcher 3.1.5]}

Regarding a cochain $\varphi\in C^1(X;G)$ as a function from paths in
$X$ to $G$, show that if $\varphi$ is a cocycle, then
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\varphi(f\sqcdot g) = \varphi(f)+\varphi(g)$,
\item $\varphi$ takes the value 0 on constant paths,
\item $\varphi(f) = \varphi(g)$ if $f\simeq g$,
\item $\varphi$ is a coboundary iff $\varphi(f)$ depends only on the
  endpoints of $f$ for all $f$.
\end{enumerate}
[In particular, (a) and (c) give a map $H^1(X;G)\to \Hom(\pi_1(X),G)$,
which the UCT says is an isomorphism if $X$ is path-connected.]

\begin{proof}
  {\it (a)}
  We begin by describing a 2-simplice $K$ in $X$. First we glue the
  vertices via 
  $(0,1,2)\mapsto (v_0,v_1,v_2)$ where $f$ starts at $v_0$ and ends at
  $v_1$ and $g$ starts at $v_1$ and ends at $v_2$. We then glue the
  1-simplices via $d_0K = g$, $d_1K = f\sqcdot g$ and $d_2 K = f$.
  The interior glues to the path $f\sqcdot g$ (do something like projection
  onto $d_1 K$ if you want an explicit map).

  In the singular chain for $X$, we have $\partial_2 K = f+g-f\sqcdot
  g$. Since $\varphi$ is a cocycle, we have
  $\varphi\circ\partial=0$. In particular
  \[ \varphi(f)+\varphi(g)-\varphi(f\sqcdot g)=0.\]
  \\
  \noindent
  {\it (b)}
  Let $c$ denotes a constant path in $X$. By (a) we have
  $\varphi(c)=\varphi(c)+\varphi(c)$.
  So $\varphi(c)=2\varphi(c)$ and thus $\varphi(c)=0$.
  \\
  \\
  \noindent
  {\it (c)}
  Let $H:I\times I\to X$ be a homotopy with $H(t,0)=f(t)$
  and $H(t,1)=g$. Note that $H$ determines two 2-simplices $K_0$ and
  $K_1$ in $X$. Let $v_0,v_1$ denote the start and endpoint of $f$
  respectively, and similarly $w_0,w_1$ for $g$.
  The first simplex $K_0$ has vertices $v_0,v_1,w_1$. The faces are
  given by $d_0K_0 = H(1,t)$ (the path between enpoints),
  $d_1 K_0 = H(t,t)$ (the diagonal map from $w_1$ to $v_0$), and $d_2
  K_0 =f$. The second simplex $K_1$ has vertices $v_0,w_0,w_1$ and
  faces $d_0 K_1 = g$, $d_1 K_1 = H(t,t)$, $d_2 K_1 = H(0,t)$ (the
  path between start points).

  Then $\partial K_0 = H(1,t)-H(t,t)+f$ and $\partial
  K_1=g-H(t,t)+H(0,t)$. Thus $\partial(K_0-K_1) =
  f-g+(H(1,t)-H(0,t))$. If $f$ and $g$ are homotopic relative
  endpoints we are done (since then $H(1,t)$ and $H(0,t)$ are
  constant).
  \\
  \\
  \noindent
  {\it (d)}
  Suppose $\varphi$ is a coboundary. Let  $\rho$ be a 0-cocycle in $X$ 
  such that $\rho\circ \partial = \varphi$. Then certainly $\varphi$
  depends only on endpoints ($\partial$ sends a 1-simplex $f$ to $v_1-v_0$
  where $v_1$ is the endpoint and $v_0$ is the start point of $f$).

  Conversely, suppose $\varphi$ is a cocycle which only depends on end
  points. For every path component of $X$ pick some point $v$. We will
  define a 0-cycle $\rho$ by specifying $\rho(w)=\varphi(f)$ where $f$
  is any path from $v$ to $w$. This is well-defined since $\varphi$
  depends only on endpoints. We wish to show that $\rho \circ \partial
  = \varphi$. Suppose $f$ is a 1-cell from $w_0$ to $w_1$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \rho\circ \partial (f) = &\rho (w_1)-\rho(w_0) \\
    =& \varphi(h_1)-\varphi(h_0) 
  \end{align*}
  where $h_i$ is the chosen path from $v$ to $w_i$. By (a),
  $\varphi(h_1)-\varphi(h_0)=\varphi(-h_0\sqcdot h_1)$. But
  $-h_0\sqcdot h_1$ is a path from $w_0$ to $w_1$. In particular
  \[ \varphi(-h_0\sqcdot h_1) = \varphi(f).\]
  Thus $\varphi = \delta(\rho)$.
  
  % where $v_0$ and $v_1$ is the start and endpoint, and where $w_0$

  
  % It suffices to show that if $f\simeq c$ where $c$ is a constant
  % path, then $\varphi(f)=0$. To see why observe that if $f\simeq g$
  % then $f\sqcdot -g \simeq c$ so \emph{(a)} gives the result. 

  % Note that a homotopy $H:I\times I\to X$ with $H(t,0)=f(t)$ and
  % $H(t,1)=c$ defines
  % a 2-simplex $K$ in $X$. It has vertices $(0,1,2)\mapsto (v_0,v_1,c)$
  % where $f$ starts at $v_0$ and ends at $v_1$ and $c$ is the point
  % that the constant map is at. It has edges $d_0 K = H(1,t)$, $d_1
  % K=H(0,t)$, and $d_2 K= f$. The interior is determined by extending
  % linearly. We then have $
  
\end{proof}







\subsection*{Question 2}
Show that if two smooth maps $f,g:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds
$M,N$ are smoothly homotopic by a smooth homotopy $H:M\times I\to N$,
then the induced maps
\[ f^*,g^*:\Omega^\bullet(N)\to \Omega^\bullet(M)\]
are chain homotopic. Hint: consider the chain homotopy described in
class
\[ h(\alpha) = \int_I H^*(\alpha). \]

\begin{proof}
  Given an $(n+1)$-form $\beta\in \Omega^{n+1}(M\times I)$ we have, in
  local coordinates,
  \[ \beta= \sum \beta_{i_1i_2\ldots i_{n+1}}dx_{i_1}\wedge \cdots
    \wedge dx_{i_{n+1}} + \sum \beta_{j_1j_2\ldots
      j_n}dt(dx_{j_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j_n}) \]
  where $\beta_{I},\beta_J \in C^\infty(X\times I)$ (where
  $I=i_1\ldots i_{n+1}$ and $J=j_1\ldots j_n$).
  Then
  \[ \int_I \beta = \sum \left(\int_0^1 \beta_J dt\right) dx_J. \]
  If $\alpha\in \Omega^{n+1}(N)$ then the above discussion allows us
  to make sense of $h(\alpha)= \int_I H^*(\alpha)$. We wish to show
  that $h$ is a chain homotopy $f^*\simeq g^*$. To do that we need to
  show that $hd+dh=g^*-f^*$. 

  Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we have that $g^*-f^*$ is
  $\int_0^1 \frac{d}{dt}(H^*(\alpha)) dt$. Let us try to show that
  $dh(\alpha)+hd(\alpha) = \int_0^1 \frac{d}{dt}(H^*(\alpha)) dt$...
  Write $h(\alpha) = \sum \left(\int_0^1 H^*(\alpha_J)
    dt\right) dx_J$ (this is a slight abuse of notation with the $dx_J$
  but we'll roll with it). Then
  \[ dh(\alpha) = \sum \partial_i\left(\int_0^1 H^*(\alpha_J)
      dt\right) dx_i\wedge dx_J.\]
  Next let us calculate $hd(\alpha)$.
  We have
  \begin{align*}
    h(d\alpha) =& -\sum \left(\int_0^1 H^*(\partial_i \alpha_J) dt
    \right) (dx_i\wedge dx_J) + \sum\left(\int_0^1
    \frac{d}{dt}H^*(\alpha_I)dt\right) dx_I \\
    =& -dh(\alpha)+(g^*-f^*).
  \end{align*}
  Note the negative follows from $d(dt\wedge \omega) =
  0 - dt\wedge d\omega$. This precisely says that
  \[ h(d\alpha)+ d(h\alpha) = g^*-f^*. \]
  Of course, here we've been incredibly sloppy with our coordinates,
  using the same coordinates for both $M$ and $N$. It doesn't even
  really make sense to sat $d(dt\wedge \omega)$ when $dt\wedge\omega$
  is presumed to a subform of $\alpha$. We ignore these
  technicalities, for the sake of our personal happiness.
  
  % we see that $hd(\alpha)$ is
  % \[ H^*(d\alpha) + \sum_{i=1}^n\intH^*(\frac{\partial \beta_J}{\partial
  %     x_i}dx_i\wedge dx_J = dH(\alpha) = 
  %   \alpha(H(1,x_1,\ldots,x_n))-\alpha(H(0,x_1,\ldots,x_n) =
  %   dg(\alpha)-df(\alpha).\]
  

  
\end{proof}








\subsection*{Question 3}
Compute the cohomology of the Klein bottle $K$ directly, and with the
UCT. Interpret the result geometrically.

\begin{proof}
  We have the following cellular chain complex for $K$:
  \begin{align*}
    0\to \bbZ\{K\}\to \bbZ\{a,b\}\to  \mathbb{Z}\{v\} \to 0
  \end{align*}
  where the boundary maps are defined via $\partial K = a+b-a+b=2b$
  and $\partial(a)=\partial(b)=0$. Dualizing gives:
  \begin{align*}
    0\leftarrow \Hom(\bbZ\{K\},\bbZ)\leftarrow \Hom(\bbZ\{a,b\},\bbZ) \leftarrow
    \Hom(\mathbb{Z}\{v\},\bbZ) \leftarrow 0
  \end{align*}
  The 0th coboundary map remains 0. In particular $H^0(K)=\bbZ$.
  The kernel of the 1st coboundary map are the homomorphisms
  $\varphi:\bbZ\{a,b\}\to \bbZ$ such that $\varphi(2b)=0$.
  Since $\varphi$ is determined on generators, and since $\bbZ$ is
  torsion free, these are all map such that $\varphi(b)=0$.
  In other words $H^1(K)$ is isomorphic to all homomorphisms
  $\bbZ\{a\}\to \bbZ$, i.e. $H^1(K)\cong \bbZ$. The image of
  $\delta^1$ are the maps $\varphi:\bbZ\{K\}\to \bbZ$ determined by
  $\varphi(K)=2d$ for some $d\in \bbZ$. To see this, observe that
  $\varphi$ factors through a map $\rho:\bbZ\{a,b\}\to\bbZ$
  via $\varphi(K) = \rho(0a+2b)=2\rho(b)=2d$. So the 2nd cohomology group is
  isomorphic to $\bbZ/2$.

  Next let us use the UCT. Recall the UCT says the following is exact:
  \[ 0\to \Ext^1_\bbZ(H_{i-1}(X),\bbZ) \to H^i(X) \to
    \Hom(H_i(X),\bbZ)\to 0.\]
  Recall the homology for $K$ is as follows:
  \[ H_i(K) =
    \begin{cases}
      \bbZ & i=0,\\
      \bbZ\oplus \bbZ/2 & i=1,\\
      0 & \textrm{else}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
  This immediately allows us to read off $H^0(K)=\bbZ$.
  Next, for $i=1$ we have
  \[ 0\to \Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ,\bbZ) \to H^1(K) \to
    \Hom(\bbZ\oplus\bbZ/2,\bbZ)\to 0.\]
  Now $\bbZ$ is free, so $\Ext^1_{\bbZ}(\bbZ,\bbZ)=0$.
  Next \[\Hom(\bbZ\oplus\bbZ/2,\bbZ)\cong
    \Hom(\bbZ,\bbZ)\oplus\Hom(\bbZ/2,\bbZ)=\{0\}\oplus \bbZ=\bbZ.\]
  Thus $H^1(K)\cong \bbZ$.
  Finally, for $i=2$ we have
   \[ 0\to \Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ\oplus\bbZ/2,\bbZ) \to H^2(K) \to
     \Hom(0,\bbZ)\to 0.\]
   In particular $H^2(K)\cong \Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ\oplus\bbZ/2,\bbZ)$.
   By $\bbZ$-linearity, we have
   \[\Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ\oplus\bbZ/2,\bbZ)\cong
     \Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ,\bbZ)\oplus
     \Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ/2,\bbZ). \]
   Since $\bbZ$ is free, $\Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ,\bbZ)=0$.
   Thus all that is left is to calculate $\Ext^1_\bbZ(\bbZ/2,\bbZ)$.
   For this we have a free resolution
   \[ 0 \to \bbZ \xrightarrow{2} \bbZ \to \bbZ/2\to 0. \]
   After chopping off $\bbZ/2$ and dualizing by taking $\Hom(-,\bbZ)$,
   we can calculate $Ext^1$ as $\bbZ/2$.
   Thus $H^2(K)=\bbZ/2$. Thus both calculations agree:
   \[ H^i(K) =
     \begin{cases}
       \bbZ & i =0,1,\\
       \bbZ/2 & i = 2,\\
       0 &\textrm{else}.
     \end{cases}
   \]

   Finally we interpret these results geometrically. We have that
   $H^i$ corresponds to codimension $i$ subspaces. For codimension 0
   we have $H^0(K)=\bbZ$. We have a generator that corresponds to the
   2-cell $K$. For codimension 1 we have two non-collapsible
   loops. (Look at the fundamental parallelogram.)
   If we choose an orientation on each of these loops and then
   traverse along the surface, one of these loops returns to its
   original orientation. This loops corresponds to the $\bbZ$. The
   other loop returns to the same spot but is going in the other
   direction. Hence we end up equating the original loop with minus
   itself, and hence this loop must be 0 in cohomology. 
   Finally for the codimension 2 we consider any point in $K$.
   If with two copies of the same point and a choice of frame at that
   point then we can move the second point around so that it is on the
   ``interior'', and the other point is at the same spot but on the
   ``exterior''. These will have different orientations and
   will ``cancel out''. Hence we obtain the $\bbZ/2$ in degree 2.

 \end{proof}










 
\subsection*{Question 4} {\bf [Hatcher 3.1.11]}

Let $X$ be a Moore space $M(\bbZ/m,n)$ obtained from $S^n$ by
attaching a cell $e^{n+1}$ by a map of degree $m$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that the quotient map $X\to X/S^n=S^{n+1}$ induces the
  trivial map on $\widetilde{H}_i(-;\bbZ)$ for all $i$ but not on
  $H^{n+1}(-;\bbZ)$. Deduce that the splitting in the UCT for
  cohomology cannot be natural.

\item Show that the inclusion $S^n\hookrightarrow X$ induces the
  trivial map on $\widetilde{H}^i(-;\bbZ)$ for all $i$, but not on
  $H_n(-;\bbZ)$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
  {\it (a)} To see that the quotient map induces the trivial map on
  reduced homology, consider the LES associated to the quotient map in
  reduced homology. Using the fact that $S^n$ is a subcomplex of the
  CW-complex $X$, we have
  \[ \cdots\to\widetilde{H}_i(S^n)\to\widetilde{H}_i(X)\to
    \widetilde{H}_i(X/S^n)\to H_{i-1}(S^n)\to\cdots \] Since we know
  the homology for spheres, we have that the quotient map is trivial
  away from $i=n+1$. But at $i=n+1$, since $X$ is a Moore space, we
  have that $\widetilde{H}_{n+1}(X)=0$ and so the quotient map is
  again trivial.

  Next we show that the quotient map is not trivial on
  $H^{n+1}(-;\bbZ)$. By the UCT we have
  $H^{n+1}(X) = \Ext^1(H_n(X),\bbZ)=\bbZ/m$ and is 0 otherwise. So our
  LES in cohomology 
  gives 
  \[ \cdots \to 0 \to \widetilde{H}^{n+1}(X/S^n)\to
    \widetilde{H}^{n+1}(X)\to \widetilde{H}^{n+1}(S^n)\to 
    \cdots \] Since $\widetilde{H}^{n+1}(S^n)=0$ and
  $\widetilde{H}^{n+1}(X)=\bbZ/m$ we must 
  have, by exactness, that $H^{n+1}(X/S^n)=\bbZ/m$ and the map induced
  by the quotient map is the identity on $\bbZ/m$.

  From this we conclude that the splitting in the UCT cannot be
  natural since the quotient map at $i=n+1$ induces the identity on
  cohomology (the middle term in UCT), but is trivial on the left and
  right terms (terms defined in terms of homology).
  \\
  \\
  \noindent
  {\it (b)} Similarly to our proof for (a) consider the LESes for the
  CW-pair $(X,S^n)$. In homology we have:
  \[ 0\to \widetilde{H}_{n+1}(X/S^n)\to \widetilde{H}_n(S^n)\to
    \widetilde{H}_n(X)\to 0. \] Filling in what we know gives
  \[ 0 \to \bbZ \to \bbZ \to \bbZ/m \to 0. \] In particular the
  boundary map must be multiplication by $m$ and the inclusion
  $S^n\hookrightarrow X$ must be the quotient map -- in particular it
  is not trivial.

  Next for cohomology. Using our calculation that the cohomology of
  $X$ is 0 away from $i=n+1$, and $\bbZ/m$ at $i=n+1$, we get that the
  map induced by the inclusion must be trivial everywhere except
  possibly when
  $i=n+1$. At $i=n+1$ we have
  \[ \cdots\to 0 \to H^{n+1}(X/S^n)\to \widetilde{H}^{n+1}(X) \to
    \widetilde{H}^{n+1}(S^n)\to \cdots \]
  But
  $\widetilde{H}^{n+1}(S^n)=0$ and so the map induced by the inclusion
  must be trivial here too.
\end{proof}
