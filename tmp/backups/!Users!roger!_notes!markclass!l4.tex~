\section{Lecture 4 -- Background in homotopy theory}

For this section we refer heavily to \cite{GepnerHandbook} and
\cite{GrothHandbook}.


Recall the {\bf simplex category} $\Delta$ is the category with
objects $[n]=\{0<1<\cdots<n\}$ and with morphisms all non-strictly
order preserving functions. For any $n$ there are coface maps
$d^k:[n]\to [n+1]$ for $0\leq k \leq n+1$ which skips $k$, and there
are codegeneracy maps $s^k:[n]\to[n-1]$ for $0\leq k\leq n-1$ which
repeats $k$. One can check that any morphism in $\Delta$ is a
composition of coface maps and codegeneracy maps.

Let $\sset$ denote the category $\Fun(\Delta^{op},\Set)$ of simplicial
sets. We think of simplicial sets diagramatically, i.e. a simplicial
set $X$ is really the diagram
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X_0\ar[r, "s_0"]&X_1\ar[l, shift left=4,"d_1"']\ar[l,shift
    right=4, "d_0"']\ar[r,shift left=2]\ar[r, shift right=2] & X_2
    \arrow[l,shift left=4]\arrow[l]\arrow[l, shift right=4]\cdots
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
where we've written $X_i$ for $X([i])$ and $d_i$ and $s_i$ for
$X(d^i)$ and $X(s^i)$ respectively. We refer to $d_i$ as the $i^{th}$
face map and $s_i$ as the $i^{th}$ degeneracy map. A cell $x\in X_i$
is degenerate if it is in the image of a degeneracy map
$s^k:X_{i-1}\to X_i$. Let $\Delta^n$ denote the representable
simplicial set $\Hom_{\sset}(-,[n])$.

We have an adjunction $
\begin{tikzcd} {|-|:\sset}\arrow[r, shift right] &
  {\Top:\Sing}\ar[l,shift right]
\end{tikzcd}
$. The functor $|-|$ takes $\Delta^n$ to the standard $n$-simplex in
$\Top$.  For an arbitrary simplicial set $X_{\bullet}$ we obtain the
space $\coprod_{n\geq 0}X_n\times |\Delta^n|/_\sim$ where $\sim$ is
equivalence relation on cells generated by the simplicial data for
$X_\bullet$, e.g. $(x,s^iy)\sim(s^i,y)$ etc. The functor $\Sing$ takes
a space $X$ and defines a simplicial set whose $n$-simplices are the
set of maps $|\Delta^n|\to X$.

\begin{aside}
  (A quick aside because I thought this construction was super neato!)
  Alternatively, we may define $|X_\bullet|$ via a {\bf Yoneda
    extension} (see \cite{GrothHandbook}). Given a small category
  $\mathcal{C}$, a cocomplete category $\mathcal{D}$ and a functor
  $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ we can extend $F$ to a colimit
  preserving functor
  $|-|_F:\Fun(\mathcal{C}^{\op},\Set)\to \mathcal{D}$ by simply
  computing $|X|_F$ via the colimit in $\mathcal{D}$. (This is the
  left Kan extension of $F$ along the Yoneda embedding.) There is a
  functor $\Sing_F$ in the reverse direction sending $C\in\mathcal{C}$
  to the presheaf $\Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(F(-),C)$ and this is a right
  adjoint. The specific example above is the case when
  $\mathcal{C}=\Delta$ and when $\mathcal{D}=\Top$ and $F$ is the
  functor taking $[n]$ to the standard $n$-simplex.
\end{aside}

Roughly speaking $\Ho(\Top)= \Top[w.e.^{-1}]$ which via
Whitehead's theorem and $\CW$-approximation is equivalent to
$\CW/_\simeq$. Similarly $\Ho(\sset)=\sset[w.e.^{-1}]$ where a {\bf
  weak  equivalence} of simplicial sets is a morphism $f:X\to Y$ such
that $|f|$ is a weak equivalence in $\Top$. The theorem is:

\begin{theorem}
  There is an equivalence of categories \[
\begin{tikzcd} {|-|:\Ho(\sset)}\arrow[r, shift right] &
  {\Ho(\Top):\Sing}\ar[l,shift right]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{theorem}
By the end of this lecture we want to hopefully say that the
$\infty$-category of simplicial sets has the same homotopy as the
$\infty$-category of topological spaces.

Some examples of simplicial sets include the boundary $\partial
\Delta^n$ which is the union of all $d_i(\Delta^n)$, and the horns
$\Lambda_k^n$ which are the union of all faces except for the $k^{th}$
face.

\begin{definition}
  A {\bf Kan complex} is a simplicial set $K$ satisfying the
  horn lifting property, i.e. any morphism $\Lambda_k^n\to K$ can be
  extended toa  map $\Delta^n\to K$ for any $0\leq k\leq n$.
\end{definition}
