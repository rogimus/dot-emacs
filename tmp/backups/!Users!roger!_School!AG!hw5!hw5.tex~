\begin{question}
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and let
  $X = \Spec\left( k[x, y]/(xy)\right)$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Classify the points and closed sets in $X$. What is the
    dimension of $X$?
  \item Show that the local rings at all except for one closed point
    $p_0$ are DVRs.
  \item What are the residue fields of the points in $X$?
  \item Describe $\Spec \calO_{X,p_0}$ .
  \item Describe all points in $\Proj k[x_0, x_1]$ explicitly.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
  \textbf{(a)} \fbox{Points}

  {\color{blue} For [Points] I forgot that $k$ was algebraically
    closed. I'm aware that maximal ideals in $k[x,y]$ for
    algebraically closed things look like $(x-a,y-b)$ but I didn't
    change my type up for [Points] because I think it works regardless
    and is nice because we get points like $(x,y^2+1)$ in
    $\Spec(\bbR[x,y]/(xy)$.}

  A point in $X$ corresponds to a maximal ideals of
  $A=k[x,y]/(xy)$. These are all going to be of the form $(x,f(x,y))$
  or $(y,g(x,y))$ for some polynomials $f(x,y),g(x,y)$ such that
  either
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $f(0,y)=0$ (resp. $g(x,0)=0$),
  \item or $f(0,y)$ is irreducible in $k[y]$ (resp. $g(x,0)$ is
    irred. in $k[x]$).
  \end{itemize}
  To see why observe an ideal $\fraka\subset A$ is prime iff the
  quotient $A/\fraka$ is an integral domain. Since $xy=0$ in
  $A/\fraka$ this is only true if $x=0$ or $y=0$ in $A/\fraka$,
  i.e. either $x\in \fraka$ or $y\in\fraka$ (or possibly
  both). Observe that $A/(x)\cong k[y]$ and $A/(y)\cong k[x]$, and
  prime ideals in here correspond to irreducible polynomials in $y$
  and $x$ respectively.

  Geometrically $X$ is the union of the $y$-axis with the $x$-axis,
  and so a point $(x,f(x,y))$ for example is telling you it's on the
  $x$-axis and it's $y$ component is determined by $f(0,y)=0$. For
  example a closed point might look like $(x,y-a)$ for some $a\in k$,
  or if $k=\bbR$ you might consider the point $(x,y^2+1)$. The point
  $(x)$ in $X$ corresponds to the generic point of
  $\bbA^1\cong \Spec (k[y])\cong \Spec(k[x,y]/(xy,x))$, i.e. $(x)$ is
  a point whose closure is the whole $y$-axis.

  \fbox{Closed Sets}

  Intuition says that closed sets $Y$ are going to be the union of
  closed sets of the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, i.e. finite unions of
  points.  To make this precise, observe that prime ideals in $k[x,y]$
  containing $(xy)$ correspond to prime ideals of $k[x,y]/(xy)$,
  i.e. $X=V(xy)$. But $(xy)=(x)(y)$ implies $V(xy)=V(x)\cup V(y)$. So
  a closed subset $Z$ of $X$ can be classified by
  $Z=(Z\cap V(x))\cup (Z\cap V(y))$.  Another way of thinking about
  this follows from our discussion about how prime ideals in
  $k[x,y]/(xy)$ must contain either $x$ or $y$.

  Thus closed subsets of $\Spec A$ correspond to the union of closed
  subsets of $V(x)$ and $V(y)$, which are finitely many points in
  each. Let us turn this topological argument into an algebraic one.

  If $Z=V(\fraka)$ for some ideal $\fraka \subset k[x,y]/(xy)$ then we
  have that $Z\cap V(x)=V((\fraka,x))$. Explicitly these are prime
  ideals in $k[x,y]/(xy)$ containing both $x$ and $\fraka$. But this
  is the same as prime ideals of $k[x,y]$ containing $x$ and $\fraka$
  since $(xy)\subset (x)$. Explicitly we have isomorphisms
  \[ \big(k[x,y]/(xy)\big)/(x, \fraka) \cong
    \big(k[x,y]/(xy,x)\big)/\fraka = \big(k[x,y]/(x)\big)/\fraka \cong
    k[y]/\overline{\fraka},\] where $\overline{\fraka}$ is the image
  of $\fraka$ under the quotient by $(x)$ map. So prime ideals in
  $V(xy)$ correspond to prime ideals of $k[y]/\overline{\fraka}$. But
  observe that since $k[y]$ is a PID, we have $\overline{\fraka}=(f)$
  for some polynomial $f$. So prime ideals of $k[y]/\overline{\fraka}$
  correspond to prime ideals of $k[y]$ containing $(f)$, but we know
  exactly what these are. These are the ideals $(f_i)$ where $f_i$ is
  an irreducible polynomial of $k[y]$ that divide $f$. Since $k[y]$ is
  a UFD we know that there are finitely many such polynomials. Thus
  $Z\cap V(x)$ consists of finitely many points. Similarly for
  $Z\cap V(y)$.

  \fbox{Dimension}

  Observe that a chain $\fraka_0\subset \fraka_1\subset\cdots$ in
  $k[x,y]/(xy)$ corresponds to a chain
  $(xy)\subset \overline{\fraka_0}\subset\overline{\fraka_1}\subset
  \cdots$ in $k[x,y]$ where $\overline{\fraka_0}=\fraka_0+(xy)$.
  Since $k[x,y]$ has Krull dimension 2 any such chain stabilizes by
  $\overline{\fraka_1}$, i.e. the Krull dimension of $k[x,y]/(xy)$ is
  $\leq 1$. To see that this is an equality, consider the chain
  $(xy)\subsetneq (x) \subsetneq (x,y)$. Thus $k[x,y]/(xy)$ has Krull
  dimension 1.  I don't think we've proven that Krull dimension equals
  the topological dimension, but it is the same proof since we're
  using the Zariski topology.

  {\textbf{(b)}} Recall that $X_{p}\cong A_\frakp$ where $\frakp$ is
  the prime ideal corresponding to $p$. We know that points correspond
  to primes that look like $(x)$, $(y)$, $(x,y-b)$, and $(x-a,y)$ for
  $a,b\in k$. In the case of $(x)$ and $(y)$ it is easy since
  $A_{(x)}\cong k[x,y]_{(x)}/(xy)\cong k[x,y]_{(x)}/(y)\cong
  (k[x,y]/(y))_{(x)}\cong k[x]_{(x)}$ which is a PID, is local, and is
  not a field. Similarly for $(y)$.

  Next we consider the case of $(x,y-b)$ and $(x-a,y)$. This is
  similar to the last paragraph. Suppose $(x,y-b)$ for $b\neq
  0$. Since localisation is an exact funtor (i.e. commutes with
  quotients), we know that $A_\frakp\cong
  (k[x,y]_{{\frakp}})/(xy)$. Thus $(xy)=(x)$ in the localization
  $k[x,y]_{\frakp}$. Then again using that localisation is exact we
  have that
  $A_\frakp=(k[x,y]/(x))_{(x,y-b)}\cong
  k[y]_{(0,y-b)}=k[y]_{(y-b)}$. This is a DVR since it is a PID, it is
  local (with unique prime $(y-b)$) and is not a field (the element
  $(y-b)$ is not invertible). The argument is mirrored for $(x-a,y)$
  for $a\neq 0$.

  The only case left is when $\frakp=(x,y)$. Since
  $k[x,y]_{(x,y)}\cong k[x,y]$ we have that
  $$A_{(x,y)}\cong (k[x,y]_{(x,y)})/(xy)\cong k[x,y]/(xy).$$ This is not
  a DVR since it isn't even an integral domain.

  \textbf{(c)} By (b) the residue field away from $p_0$ is isomorphic
  to $k$. At $p_0$ the unique maximal ideal is $(x,y)$ so the residue
  field is again just $k$.



  \textbf{(d)} By our discussion in (b) we have that $A_{(x,y)}\cong A$. Since
  $\calO_{X,p_0}\cong A_{(x,y)}$ we have that
  $\Spec \calO_{X,p_0}\cong \Spec A=X$.
