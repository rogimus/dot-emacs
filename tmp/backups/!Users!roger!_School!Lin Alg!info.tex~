\item[Grade:] The tutorials for Math 20580 are worth 40 points out of
  the total 550 points available for the class. These points come from
  {\bf quizzes} (25\%=10pts) and {\bf worksheets} (75\%=30pts).
\item[Quiz:] There will be a quiz every week starting from week two,
  except for the weeks in which there is an exam (week five and
  twelve). The quiz is 10 minutes long and will take place at the
  beginning of class. Typically the quiz will cover content from the
  previous week's worksheet. The quizzes are worth {\bf 25\% of your
    tutorial grade}. At the end of semester, each person's {\bf worst
    scoring quiz} will be {\bf dropped} from their grade.
\item[Worksheet:] In the remaining 40 minutes of class, students will
  split into small groups and work collaboratively together on a
  worksheet. The worksheet covers recent material from the
  lectures. One worksheet from each group is to be handed in to the TA
  by 5pm the following Friday (with the overall goal for the worksheet
  to be finished by class end). This is to allow for extra time if
  needed while also hopefully preserving your weekend. Three questions
  from every worksheet will be graded for correctness/accuracy and the
  remaining questions are simply graded for completeness. Altogether
  the worksheets are worth {\bf 75\% of the tutorial grade}. At the
  end of semester, each person's {\bf worst scoring worksheet} will be
  {\bf dropped} from their grade.

\item[Attendance:] This is all mentioned in the general information
  sheet (on the website). To rehash, attendance to tutorials is
  mandatory. An excused absence from class will result in that quiz
  and worksheet not being counted.
