\subsection*{Question 1}
{\bf [Hatcher 3.3.6]}

\noindent
Lets $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two disjoint connected $n$-manifolds.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are closed then there are
  isomoprhisms $H_i(M_1\# M_2)\cong H_i(M_1)\oplus H_i(M_2)$ for
  $0<i<n$, with one exception: If both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are
  nonorientable, then $H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2)$ is obtained from
  $H_{n-1}(M_1)\oplus H_{n-1}(M_2)$ by replacing one of the two $\bbZ/2$
  summands by a $\bbZ$ summand. [Euler characteristics may be helpful in
  this case.]
\item 
  Show that $\chi(M_1 \# M_2) = \chi(M_1)+\chi(M_2)-\chi(S^n)$ if
  $M_1$ and $M_2$ are closed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
  \phantom{ }\\
  \noindent
  (a) This follows quickly by considering the LES of the pair $(M_1\#
  M_2, S^{n-1})$ where $S^{n-1}$ is the boundary of the disc on which $M_1$
  and $M_2$ are glued. Since $H_i(S^{n-1})=0$ for $0<i<n-1$, we get that the
  LES breaks into sequences
  \[ \begin{tikzcd}
      0\to 0\to H_i(M_1\# M_2) \to H_i(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1}) \to 0
    \end{tikzcd} \]
  for $0<i<n-1$.
  We also get another sequence
  \[ 0 \to H_n(M_1\#M_2) \to H_n(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1}) \to \bbZ \to
    H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) \to H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1}) \to 0. \]
  Since the $(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1})$ is a good pair, we get
  \[ H_i(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1}) \cong H_i(M_1\# M_2 / S^{n-1}) \cong
    H_i( M_1\vee M_2) = H_i(M_1)\oplus H_i(M_2).\]
  In the case that both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are orientable we then get
  \[ 0 \to \bbZ \to \bbZ\oplus\bbZ \to \bbZ \xrightarrow{i_*}
    H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) \to H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2, S^{n-1}) \to 0. \]
  In this case $i_*$ must clearly be 0 for exactness, and thus
  the result holds.

  If only one of $M_1$ or $M_2$ is orientable (WLOG assume $M_1$)
  then we obtain
  \[ 0 \to 0 \to \bbZ \xrightarrow{\partial} \bbZ \xrightarrow{i_*}
    H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) \to H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2, S^n) \to 0. \]
  The map $\partial$ must be the identity on $\bbZ$. That is, the the
  fundamental class
  for $M_1$ in $H_n(M_1)$ has boundary precisely the fundamental
  class for 
  $S^{n-1}$. This is essentially by definition of a fundamental
  class. Indeed take the disc $D$ we cut out from $M_1$ and take a
  point $x$ inside the disc. Then the fundamental class $[M]$ by
  definition restricts to a generator of $H_n(M,M\setminus \{x\})
  \cong H_n(D,D\setminus \{ x\}) \cong \widetilde{H}_{n-1} (S^{n-1})$.
  Thus again, $i_*$
  is 0 and the result holds.

  Finally, if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are nonorientable, then we obtain
  \[ 0 \to  0 \to 0 \to \bbZ \xrightarrow{i_*}
    H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) \to H_{n-1}(M_1)\oplus H_{n-1}(M_2) \to 0. \]
  Here $H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) = \bbZ/2 \oplus \bbZ^n$ for some $n$ and
  $H_{n-1}(M_1)\oplus H_{n-1}(M_2) = \bbZ/2\oplus \bbZ/2 \oplus
  \bbZ^m$ for some $m$. (Here we've
  used Cor 3.28 of Hatcher.)  Since the right map is surjective, at
  least one of the $\bbZ$ must map onto a $\bbZ/2$. Furthermore, the
  $\bbZ/2$ in $H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2)$ \emph{must} map to a $\bbZ/2$
  since otherwise it must map to 0, and hence must be hit by something
  from $i_*$ which is impossible since $i_*$ is injective. By exactness, the
  kernel of this map is the image of $i_*$. Thus we can write
  $H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2) = \bbZ/2 \oplus \bbZ \oplus \bbZ^{n-1}$ where
  the first two terms map onto $\bbZ/2\oplus \bbZ/2$ and the first
  $\bbZ$ is the image of $i_*$. Since $i_*$ maps $\bbZ$ into the
  kernel, it must be multiplication by two on the $\bbZ$
  term. Finally, the fact that this is a SES means  $H_{n-1}(M_1\#
  M_2, S^{n-1}) \cong H_{n-1}(M_1\# M_2)/2\bbZ$ which says that
  $n-1=m$ which gives the result.
  \\
  \\
  \noindent
  (b) This follows from a counting argument, and (a). In particular we
  have that the ranks of $H_i(M_1\# M_2)$ is equal to $\rk
  H_i(M_1)+\rk H_i(M_2)-\rk H_i(S^n)$ for $0<i<n-1$.
  Since $M_1$ and $M_2$ are connected, we have
  \[ 1= \rk H_0(M_1) +\rk H_0(M_2)-\rk H_0(S^n) = \rk H_0(M_1\#
    M_2). \]
  When $i=n-1$ we get $\rk H_i (S^n) = 1$. In the case $M_1$ and
  $M_2$ are nonorientable, by (a) we have
  \[ \rk H_{n-1}(M_1 \# M_2) = \rk H_{n-1}(M_1) + \rk H_{n-1}(M_2) +
    1. \]
  This $+1$ matches up with the 1 coming from $H_n(S^n)$ and we get
  the result.

  In the case that at least one of $M_1$ and $M_2$ is orientable, then by 
  (a) we have $\rk H_{n-1} (M_1\# M_2) = \rk H_{n-1} (M_1) +\rk
  H_{n-1}(M_2)$. If only one of them is orientable (assume WLOG it's
  $M_1$) then we have +1
  coming from $H_n(M_1)$ which cancels with the +1 coming from
  $H_n(S^n)$.

  In the case that both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are orientable, then so too is
  $M_1\# M_2$ and we end up with
  \[ \rk H_n(M_1\# M_2) = 1 = 1+1-1 = \rk H_n(M_1)+\rk H_n (M_2) - \rk
    H_n(S^n). \] 
\end{proof}




\subsection*{Question 2}
{\bf [Hatcher 3.3.7]}
\\
\noindent
For a map $f:M\to N$ between connected closed orientable $n$-manifolds
with fundamental classes $[M]$ and $[N]$, the \emph{degree} of $f$ is
defined to be the integer $d$ such that $f_*([M]) = d[N]$, so the sign
of the degree depends on the choice of fundamental classes. Show that
for any connected closed orientable $n$-manifold $M$ there is a degree
1 map $M\to S^n$.

\begin{proof}
  \phantom{ }
  \\
  \noindent
  Take some $n$-disk $D$ in $M$. Construct $f$ as the map which sends
  $D$ to $S^n\setminus \{N\}$ where $N$ is the north pole, and
  which maps $M\setminus D$ to $N$. Then, by definition, $[M]$ maps to
  the generator of $H_n(M,M\setminus D)$. The pair $(M, M\setminus D)$
  is a good pair. To see this, we can replace $D$ with a slightly
  smaller disk contained in $D$. This gives a neighbourhood
  deformation onto $D$. In particular we then get an isomorphism
  $H_n(M,M\setminus D)\cong H_n(M/(M\setminus D))$. Since $M/(M\setminus
  D)\simeq D/\partial D \simeq S^n$ we have that $[M]$ maps to the
  generator of $H_n(S^n)$. Thus $f$ is a map such that $f_*([M])= \pm
  [S^n]$. If $f_*([M]) = -[S^n]$ then compose $f$ with an orientation
  reversing map on the sphere, i.e.
  \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & \ldots &  &  0  \\
      0 & \ddots &  & \vdots \\
      \vdots &  & 1 & 0  \\
      0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
\end{proof}






\subsection*{Question 3}
{\bf [Hatcher 3.3.24]}

\noindent
Let $M$ be a closed connected 3-manifold, and write $H_1(M)$ as
$\bbZ^r\oplus F$, the direct sum of a free abelian group of rank $r$
and a finite group $F$. Show that $H_2(M)$ is $\bbZ^r$ if $M$ is
orientable, and $\bbZ^{r-1}\oplus \bbZ/2$ if $M$ is non-orientable. In
particular, $r\geq 1$ when $M$ is non-orientable. Using 3.3.6,
construct examples showing there are no other restrictions on homology
groups of closed 3-manifolds. [In the non-orientable case, consider
the manifold $N$ obtain from $S^2\times I$ by identifying $S^2\times
\{0\}$ with $S^2 \times \{1\}$ via a reflection of $S^2$.]

\begin{proof}
  \phantom{ }\\
  \noindent
  By Corollary 3.28 of Hatcher, if $M$ is orientable the torsion
  subgroup of $H_2(M)$ is trivial, and if $M$ is non-orientable it is
  $\bbZ/2$. All that is left is to show that the free part of $H_2$ is
  $\bbZ^{r-1}$ if $M$ is non-orientable, and $\bbZ^r$ if $M$ is
  orientable.

  First let us assume that $M$ is orientable. In this case
  we can use Poincar\'e duality, which we use alongside the universal
  coefficient theorem (UCT). Poincar\'e duality says that $H_1(M)\cong
  H^2(M)$. The UCT says that the following is exact:
  \[  0\to \Ext^1_\bbZ(H_1(M),\bbZ) \to H^2(M) \to \Hom_\bbZ
    (H_2(M),\bbZ)\to 0. \]
  To compute $\Ext^1(\bbZ^r\oplus F,\bbZ)$ we can take a projective
  resolution
  \[ 0 \to \bbZ^m \to \bbZ^m \oplus \bbZ^r \to \bbZ^r \oplus F \to
    0. \]
  Taking $\Hom_\bbZ(- ,\bbZ)$ and removing the first time gives a cochain
  complex 
  \[ 0 \to \Hom_\bbZ(\bbZ^m\oplus \bbZ^r, \bbZ) \to
    \Hom_\bbZ(\bbZ^r,\bbZ)\to  0. \]
  We have $\Hom_\bbZ(\bbZ^m\oplus\bbZ^r,\bbZ)\cong \bbZ^m\oplus
  \bbZ^r$. To see this recall we have $\Hom_\bbZ(\oplus_n \bbZ,\bbZ)
  \cong \bigoplus_n \Hom_\bbZ(\bbZ,\bbZ)$.
  Taking homology at $\Hom_\bbZ(\bbZ^m\oplus \bbZ^r,\bbZ)$ gives
  $\bbZ^m$. Then, by exactness we get that
  $\Hom_\bbZ(H_2(M),\bbZ)\cong (\bbZ^m\oplus \bbZ^r) / \bbZ^m \cong
  \bbZ^r$.

  In thinking of a way to solve it for $M$ non-orientable, I've
  realized we can simply use the Euler characteristc for $M$. Since
  $M$ is odd dimensional, we have that $\chi(M)=0$. In the
  non-orientable case this means $1-r+k-0=0$ where $k$ is $\rk
  H_2(M)$. Thus $k=r-1$ and by our earlier discussion (involving Cor
  3.28) we have $H_2(M)\cong \bbZ^{r-1}\oplus \bbZ/2$.

  \begin{remark*}
    This same argument provides a much simpler argument that if $M$ is
    orientable then $H_2(M)=\bbZ^r$. I already typed this though and
    this way is kind of fun. Secretly it's probably an equivalent
    proof since Poincar\'e duality is the key to showing the Euler
    characteristic is 0 (even for the case when $M$ is orientable). By
    looking at the proof of $\chi(M)=0$ for $\dim M=3$, I
    guess there might be a fun way of proving this question for the
    non-orientable case by using the UCT and Poincar\'e duality with
    coefficients in $\bbZ/2$. 
  \end{remark*}

  For the second part of the question, consider the 3-manifold
  $S^2\times I$.
