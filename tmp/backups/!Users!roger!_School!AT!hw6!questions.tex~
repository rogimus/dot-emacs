\subsection*{Question 1}

Consider the Hopf map:
\[ \eta : S^3\hookrightarrow \bbC^2\setminus 0 \xrightarrow{p} \CP^1\approx S^2, \]
where $p(x,y)=[x:y]$.
Show that
\[ \CP^2\approx S^2 \cup_{\eta} D^4. \]

\begin{proof}
  We've seen before (in class or Hatcher Example 0.6] that $\CP^n$ is
  obtained by gluing a $D^{2n}$ onto $\CP^{n-1}$. 
  This is glued 
  
  This is Example 0.6 from Hatcher. In
  particular we can show that $\CP^n$ is the quotient of $D^{2n}$
  which identifies $v$ 
  with $\lambda v$ for all $\lambda \in \bbC$ and $v\in \partial D^{2n}=
  S^{2n-1}$.  We also showed this in class.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Assuming as know the cup product structure on the torus $T=S^1\times
S^1$, compute the cup product structure in $H^*(M_g)$ for $M_g$ by
using the quotient map from $M_g$ to a wedge sum of $g$ tori.
