\section{L19 -- Towards Trace Methods}

In our previous computations of $\KK(R)$ we made use of three
strategies: (1) use group cohomology; (2) have a guess to compare
with; (3) AHSS and $l$-complete away from $p$ {\color{orange} ``or
  SHg but might not work at $p$''}. These all have problems though
going forward: group cohomology is too hard; we might not always have
a guess; and we might need to be able to work at $p$.

The {\bf idea} is if $R\in \CAlg(\Sp)$ then consider a map called the
{\bf cyclotomic trace} \[\KK(R)\longrightarrow\TC(R)\]
where $\TC(R)$ is the {\bf topological cyclic homology} of $R$. This
trace map will be ``almost an equivalence'' and $\TC(R)$ will be farm
more computable than $\KK(R)$.

\begin{notation}
for us we will always be working $p$-complete for some
prime $p$.
\end{notation}


\subsection{Motivation}


{\color{orange} Perhaps the best person to ask about where the
  motivation for this stuff came from is Thomas Goodwillie, who
  figured out a lot of this stuff while studying the geometry of loop
  spaces. Mark thinks a good comparison is that of the Chern
  character.  }


The Chern character is a ring homomorphism
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \mathrm{ch}:\KU^0(X)\ar[r]& \HH^{\mathrm{ev}}(X;\bQ)
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
where the ring structure on the LHS is the tensor product, and on the
right it is the cup product. To get something in cohomology the map
ought to pick out some kind of characteristic class, i.e. like the
first Chern class for a line bundle. But since
$c_1(L\otimes L^\prime)=c_1(L)+c_1(L^\prime)$ we should
exponentiate. Thus the Chern character is determined (by the splitting
principle) by:
\[L\longmapsto \exp(c_1(L))=\sum \frac{c_1(L)^i}{i!}\] for $L$ a line
bundle over $X$.

\begin{theorem}
  The Chern character $\mathrm{ch}$ is a rational isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

On to algebraic $\KK$-theory. Let $X=\Spec(R)$ for a classical ring
$R$. We need something analogous to the even cohomology of $X$. For
this we take de Rham cohomology $\HH_{\mathrm{dR}}^*(X)$ which is the
cohomology of the complex $\Omega^*(X)$ of differential forms on $X$
which is related to the cotangent complex $\mathrm{T}^*X$. For $M$ a
manifold the tangent bundle $\mathrm{T}M$ is the normal bundle $
\begin{tikzcd}
  \nu(M\arrow[r,hook,"\Delta"]&M\times M).
\end{tikzcd}
$ Now if we further assume $X$ is a $k$-scheme for some ring $k$ then
we have the diagonal
\[
  \Spec R\to X\times_k X=\Spec (R\otimes_k R)
\]
which corresponds to the multiplication homomorphism
$R\otimes_k R\to R$. Denote the kernel of this map by $I_R$. Then the
1-forms/are K\"ahler differentials are defined as
\[
  \Omega^1(X/k) = I_R/I_R^2.
\]
One path forward is to simply define a complex
$\Omega_{\mathrm{dR}^*}$ as exterior powers
$\Lambda^*_R \Omega^1(X/k)$. That's a perfectly reasonable thing to do
and this is called {\bf algebraic de Rham cohomology} of $X$. This
isn't what we are going to do.

Instead we are going to take the derived intersection of the diagonal
with itself: $X\dtenssch{X\times_k X}X$. In terms of rings we get the
derived tensor product:
\[
  R\dtens{R\otimes_kR}R.
\]
Why is this the thing we want to consider? One of the key advantages
of working in the derived setting is the ability to see intersection
data, i.e. multiplicities. Consider a transverse intersection, versus
a quadratic intersection, versus a cubic intersection. In the derived
setting each of these is somehow richer than the previous. So taking
the derived intersection of something with itself should be very rich!
``And the claim is that very rich things should be like functions on
the normal bundle''. Thus we give this thing a name:

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf Hochschild homology} of $R$ relative to $k$ is
  \[\HH\HH(R/k):=R\dtens{R\otimes_k R}R\]
  in $\in \CAlg(\cD(k)^\otimes)$.
\end{definition}

This is supposed to be like ``(derived) functions on the normal
bundle''. As motivation to see why consider a classical commutative
ring $R$ and suppose we have a finitely generated projective
$R$-module $M\in \Mod_R^{\mathrm{fg,\,proj}}$. Then we obtain a
quasi-coherent sheaf/vector bundle $\widetilde{M}$ over $X$. Then
$\Sym_R(M)$ is an $R$-algebra and thus we have a map
\[\Spec(\Sym_R(M))\longrightarrow\Spec(R)\]
and we think of the LHS as the total space $V$ and the RHS the base
$X$. The de Rham complex is an exterior algebra, which we can also
write as $\Sym(\Omega^1(X/k)[1])$ where we shift the 1-forms into an
odd degree. This is somehow meant to model (shifted) functions on the
normal bundle.

\begin{definition}
  If $R$ is flat over $k$ then define the {\bf Hochschild homology
    groups} of $R$ relative to $k$ are given by
  \[ \Tor_*^{R\otimes_k R}(R,R).\]
\end{definition}
In $\CAlg(\cD(k))$ Hochschild homology $\HH\HH(R/k)$ is given by
\[
    \varinjlim\left( 
  \begin{tikzcd}
    R\otimes_k R\ar[r]\ar[d]& R\\R
  \end{tikzcd}\right)
\]
