Federico Ardila's four axioms of mathematics education form the foundation of my attitudes towards mathematics education. They are:

"Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect."

The first thing that I focus on in any classroom is setting the right environment. It goes without saying that fostering a kind, compassionate, welcoming, and collaborative environment seems to be incredibly beneficial for a myriad of reasons.  To foster an inviting environment I have found many things successful, including: learning students names; taking the time to talk to students before and after class; always encouraging students questions and ideas; sharing my experiences learning math and all the things I struggled with the first time; sharing my enthusiasm for maths; treating my students as humans with vast lives outside of my class; and being empathetic towards a students particular struggles and taking the time to help guide themselves to the right answer.

One thing that I always appreciated in my mathematical journey was when teachers strove for more accessibility, and I think the power of modern technology has made it very easy to make steps towards accessibility. One thing that I find work really well is lecture recordings, simply to have for future reference, or for the days when life happens and you can't make class. Another thing is posting lecture notes online for the students. I've found asking for (anonymous) feedback from students very powerful to get a feel for things I could do better, or things I could do to further help the students. I also think the use of technology within class time can be incredibly powerful. Some examples include using or writing instructive applets, pulling up pre-drawn pictures on a tablet, or simply projecting a small question for the class to spend a few minutes on. Finally I try to often remind the students that I am available to help outside of class.

Mathematics is a useful, empowering, and fun tool, and it is ubiquitous throughout academic disciplines and life more generally. This makes the role of maths educators a critical one. Part of a maths educators job is to constantly look for ways to improve, to better position themself to share the joys of problem solving and mathematics.

Getting stuck is a part of doing mathematics, and this is somewhat unique to mathematics. Thus t to assure all students that their "being stuck" is seen as valid and is not met with shame. To foster an inviting environment I have found many things successful, including: learning students names; taking the time to talk to students before and after class; always encouraging students questions and ideas; sharing my experiences learning math and all the things I struggled with the first time; sharing my enthusiasm for maths; and being empathetic towards a students particular struggles and taking the time to help guide themselves to the right answer.
